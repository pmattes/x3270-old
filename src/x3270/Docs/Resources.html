<TITLE>x3270 Resources</TITLE>
<H1>x3270 Resources</H1>

Here is a complete list of the customizable X resources used by x3270, their
meanings, default values, command-line switches and menu options that change
them.
<P>
Note that any resource can be set on the command line with the -xrm switch.
<PRE>
x3270.adVersion		Default 3.0.3
    Used to synchronize the version of x3270 with the app-defaults file.  This
    is often the same as the x3270 version number, but not always.  Whenever
    an incompatible change is made in x3270's resource definitions, the number
    is changed.  If you upgrade x3270 to a new release, and merely change this
    number in your app-defaults file (rather than finding out what really
    changed), very bad things will happen.

x3270.emulatorFont	Default 3270 (*)	Switch -efont
			Options 3270 Font
			        3270-12 Font
			        Debug Font
			        Other Font...
    The font used for the emulator window.  By default it is 3270, a 14-pixel
    clone of a real 3278 display font.  A nice substitution is 3270-12, which
    is a little more compact.  Actually, x3270 can use any X font, so long as
    it uses constant spacing.  However, only 3270 and 3270-12 allow displaying
    all special symbols on the status line.

    (*) Actually, the default for emulatorFont is the value of the first font
    in the fontList resource, below.

x3270.foreground	Default black		Switches: -fg, -rv
    The foreground color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome displays, the
    emulator display.

x3270.background	Default white		Switches: -bg, -rv
    The background color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome displays, the
    emulator display.

x3270.colorBackground	Default black
    The background color for the emulator window (color displays only).  On
    monochrome displays, the background color is white, unless -rv (reverse
    video) is selected on the command line.

x3270.selectBackground	Default dim gray
    On color displays, this is the background color used for selected text
    (text highlighted with the mouse for cut and paste).  On monochrome
    displays, selected text is in reverse video.

x3270.keypadBackground	Default grey70
    On color displays, this is the color of the empty area behind the buttons
    on the main window and keypad window.  On monochrome displays, these areas
    are filled with a 50% grey bitmap.

x3270.cursorColor	Default red
    On color displays, this is the color of the text cursor.  This resource
    is used only if the x3270.useCursorColor resource is set to true.

x3270.normalColor	Default green
    On color displays in pseudo-color mode, this is the color of
    normal-intensity text.  On monochrome displays, normal text uses the
    foreground color.

x3270.inputColor	Default orange
    On color displays in pseudo-color mode, this is the color of light-pen
    selectable fields.  If the resource x3270.modifiedSel is set to true,
    modified fields are also displayed in this color.  On monochrome displays,
    these fields are indistinguishable from other normal-intensity text.

x3270.boldColor		Default cyan
    On color displays in pseudo-color mode, this is the color of
    high-intensity text.  (See the description of boldFont for how it works on
    monochrome displays.)

x3270.neutralBlackColor	Default black
x3270.blueColor		Default deepSkyBlue
x3270.redColor		Default red
x3270.pinkColor		Default pink
x3270.greenColor	Default green
x3270.turquioseColor	Default turquoise
x3270.yellowColor	Default yellow
x3270.neutralWhiteColor	Default white
x3270.blackColor	Default black
x3270.deepBlueColor	Default blue3
x3270.orangeColor	Default orange
x3270.purpleColor	Default purple
x3270.paleGreenColor	Default paleGreen
x3270.paleTurquoiseColor Default paleTurquoise2
x3270.greyColor		Default grey
x3270.whiteColor	Default white
    In full-color mode, these are the X colors to use for each of the 16
    IBM 3279 colors.

x3270.waitCursor	Default watch
    The name of the mouse cursor displayed when x3270 is connected to a host,
    but is unable to process keyboard input.  Cursor names are in the file
    <X11/cursorfont.h>.

x3270.lockedCursor	Default X_cursor
    The name of the mouse cursor displayed with x3270 is not connected to a
    host.

x3270.icrnl		Default true
x3270.inlcr		Default false
    These resources are used in ANSI mode, and are similar to the "stty"
    parameters of the same name.  They control whether input carriage returns
    are mapped to newlines, and newlines are mapped to carriage returns,
    respectively.

x3270.erase		Default ^?
x3270.kill		Default ^U
x3270.werase		Default ^W
x3270.rprnt		Default ^R
x3270.lnext		Default ^V
x3270.intr		Default ^C
x3270.quit		Default ^\\
x3270.eof		Default ^D
    These resources are also used in ANSI mode, but only when communicating
    in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270 gathers a line of input before
    forwarding it to the host).  They define the special characters used for
    editing input, and have exactly the same functions as the "stty" parameters
    of the same names.

    The erase, werase and kill resources are also used in reverse.  When
    connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), these are the ASCII characters that are sent to
    the host in response to the Erase, DeleteWord and DeleteField actions,
    respectively.

x3270.altCursor		Default false		Switch -set altCursor
			Option Underline Cursor	       -clear altCursor
			       Block Cursor
    When set to true, this causes x3270 to use with the alternate (underscore)
    cursor.

x3270.blankFill		Default false		Option Blank Fill
			Switch -set blankFill
			       -clear blankFill
    When set to true, in 3270 mode x3270 will automatically convert trailing
    blanks in a field to nulls in order to insert a character, and will
    automatically convert leading nulls to blanks so that input data is not
    squeezed to the left.  This eliminates some of the quirkier behavior of
    real 3270 terminals.

x3270.cursorBlink	Default false		Switch -set cursorBlink
						       -clear cursorBlink
    When set to true, this causes x3270 to use a blinking cursor.

x3270.cursorPos		Default true		Switch -set cursorPos
			Option Track Cursor	       -clear cursorPos
    When set to true, causes x3270 to display the cursor location on the
    status line.

x3270.doConfirms	Default true
    When set to true, x3270 will display a pop-up to report successful
    completion of certain operations, such as screen printing.  When
    set to false, these pop-ups are not displayed.

x3270.dsTrace		Default false		 Switch -trace 
			Option Trace Data Stream        -set dsTrace
							-clear Trace
    When true, x3270 writes a hexadecimal representation of all network
    traffic, and its interpretation, into the file /usr/tmp/x3trc.<pid>.  It
    also pops up a window to watch the file as it is created, with the
    pathname of the file as the window title.  The command run in the window
    is defined by the traceCommand resource.  The directory prefix is
    defined by the traceDir resource.

x3270.eventTrace	Default false		 Switch -set eventTrace
			Option Trace X Events           -clear eventTrace
    When true, x3270 traces information about the X events that it processes
    into the file /usr/tmp/x3trc.<pid>.  It also pops up a window to watch the
    file as it is created, with the pathname of the file as the window title.
    The command run in the window is defined by the traceCommand resource.
    The directory prefix is defined by the traceDir resource.

x3270.lineWrap		Default true		Switch -set lineWrap
			Option Wraparound	       -clear lineWrap
    When set to true, in ANSI mode x3270 will automatically insert a 
    Newline then output reaches the end of a line.  When false, output can
    pile up at the end of each line.

x3270.marginedPaste	Default false		Switch -set marginedPaste
			Option Paste With Left Margin  -clear marginedPaste
    When set to true, x3270 will use the current cursor position as a left
    margin for pasted data: no pasted data will be input into an area to the
    left of the current cursor positon.

x3270.monoCase		Default false		Switch -set monoCase
			Option Monocase		       -clear monoCase
    When true, causes x3270 to run in uppercase-only mode.

x3270.numericLock	Default false
    When true, causes x3270 to lock the keyboard when non-numeric data is
    entered into fields with the Numeric attribute.

x3270.rectangleSelect	Default false		Switch -set rectangleSelect
			Option Select by Rectangles    -clear rectangleSelect
    When set to true, x3270 will always select rectangular areas of the
    screen.  When false, x3270 will select rectangular areas in 3270 mode, but
    in ANSI mode it will select continuous areas of the screen like xterm.

x3270.screenTrace	Default false		Switch -set screenTrace
			Option Save Screen(s) in File  -clear screenTrace
    When true, x3270 will save an ASCII version of the screen image in
    the file /usr/tmp/x3scr.<pid>, every time it is redrawn.  The directory
    prefix is defined by the traceDir resource.

x3270.scrollBar		Default false		Switches -sb, +sb
			Option Scrollbar		 -set scrollBar
							 -clear scrollBar
    When true, x3270 will display a scroll bar to the right of the emulator
    window.

x3270.showTiming	Default false		Switch -set showTiming
			Option Show Timing	       -clear showTiming
    When true, x3270 will display on the status line the time that the host
    takes to unlock the keyboard after an AID is sent.

x3270.allowResize	Default true
    When true, the x3270 window can be resized by the mouse (actually, by the
    window manager).  When false, the window can only be resized from menu
    options.  The purpose of disabling mouse resizing is to allow a window
    bigger than will fit on the screen, which some window managers (e.g., mwm)
    will not allow if permitted to resize it.

x3270.activeIcon	Default false		Switch -activeicon
    This one is a lot of fun.  When set to true, x3270's icon becomes a live
    miniature of the screen display.  There are some limitations, spelled out
    in the man page.

x3270.bellVolume	Default 0
    Controls the volume used when ringing the terminal bell.  The value
    ranges from -100 (silent) through 0 (normal) to +100 (loud).  Not all
    X servers can vary the bell volume, other than turning it on and off.
    This resource can be overridden by the x3270.visualBell resource, which
    if set to true, will replace the bell with a flash of the screen.

x3270.charset		Default bracket		Switch -charset
    This defines the EBCDIC character set, that is, what glyph (image) is
    displayed for each EBCDIC code.

    For each character set x, an additional resource by the name of charset.x
    must be defined.  These resources consist of a series of newline-separated
    strings that define how an EBCDIC national character set differs from IBM's
    standard U.S.-International set (table 01).  Each string is a number, a
    colon, and a symbol.  The number is the EBCDIC code, and the symbol is an
    ASCII character or ISO Latin-1 name of the graphic it represents.

x3270.charset.us-intl
x3270.charset.us
x3270.charset.apl
x3270.charset.bracket
x3270.charset.oldibm
x3270.charset.german
x3270.charset.finnish
x3270.charset.uk
x3270.charset.norwegian
x3270.charset.french
x3270.charset.hebrew
    Character set definitions.

x3270.composeMap	Default latin1
    Gives the name of the map used to define the pairs of characters that
    form composite characters with the Compose key.

x3270.composeMap.latin1
x3270.composeMap.apl
    Foe each compose map x, an additional resource by the name of composeMap.x
    must be defined.  Each line in the resource is of the form
    "keysym1 + keysym2 = keysym3", meaning "when the Compose key is pressed,
    followed by keysym1 and keysym2 (in either order), interpret it as
    keysym3."  The definitions are case-sensitive.

x3270.debugTracing	Default true
    If set to true, options are available on the File menu to trace the 3270
    data stream and X events.  If set to false, these options are not
    displayed.

x3270.extended		Default false		Switch -extended
    If set to true, enables support of the 3270 Extended Data Stream, which
    allows extended highlighting, structured fields, and query reply.  The
    actual difference is that a "-E" is appended to the default terminal
    name which is passed to the host through TELNET negotiations, indicating
    support for the feature.  If the x3270.m3279 resource is true,
    x3270.extended is automatically assumed to be true as well.

x3270.hostsFile		Default /usr/lib/X11/x3270/ibm_hosts
    The name of a file listing the host names that appear on the "Connect"
    pull-down menu.  The format of the file is explained on the ibm_hosts man
    page.

x3270.invertKeypadShift	Default false
    When set to true, this causes the PF1-PF12 and PF13-PF24 keys on the
    pop-up keypad to be swapped.  Normally, the low-numbered keys appear;
    when Shift, Alt, Ctrl or Meta is pressed, the high-numbered keys appear.
    With this resource set to true, that is reversed.

x3270.keymap		No Default		Switch -keymap
    The name of the keyboard map to use.  If no keymap resource is specified,
    the environment variables KEYMAP and KEYBD are checked (in that order) for
    the keymap name.

    For each keymap x, an additional resource by the name x3270.keymap.x must
    be defined, which gives the actual key mappings.  These are in X
    translation table format.

    The name may be followed by any number of comma-separated modifier names,
    e.g., if the keymap name "sun-k4,ow", means keymap "sun-k4" and modifier
    "ow".

    For each keymap modifier x, an additional resource by the name
    x3270.keymap.x must be defined, which gives the actual key mappings.
    These are also in X translation table format.

x3270.keymap.sun-k5
x3270.keymap.sun-k4
x3270.keymap.sun-k3
x3270.keymap.ncd
x3270.keymap.hp-k1
x3270.keymap.hp-pc
    These are predefined keymaps.

x3270.keymap.ow
x3270.keymap.apl
x3270.keymap.alt
x3270.keymap.t
x3270.keymap.finnish7
x3270.keymap.norwegian7
    These are predefined keymap modifiers:
    - "ow" makes the mouse work more like OpenWindows defaults
    - "apl" is automatically applied when in apl mode (the -apl switch is used)
    - "alt" maps many of the "Meta" key actions to "Alt" key actions, for
	keyboards which lack a "Meta" key
    - "t" is useful for keymap debugging; it maps Meta-z to an action that
	displays the current keymap
    - "finnish7" and "norwegian7" are for compatibility with certain 7-bit
	international keyboards

x3270.keypad		Default right
    This controls the position of the pop-up keypad.  It can have one of
    four values: left, meaning a pop-up window positioned to the left of the
    main x3270 window; right, meaning a pop-up window positioned to the right
    of the main x3270 window; bottom, meaning a pop-up window positioned below
    the main x3270 window; and integral, making the keypad an extension of the
    bottom of the main window itself.

x3270.keypadOn		Default false
    If set to true, the keypad will automatically appear when x3270 is started.

x3270.labelIcon		Default false
    When activeIcon is true, MIT's twm window manager will not put a label on
    x3270's icon.  Setting labelIcon to true causes x3270 to supply its own
    label for the icon.

x3270.m3279		Default false		Switch -color
    If true and running on a color display, x3270 runs in full 3279 color
    mode.  If false, x3270 runs in pseudo-color mode, with colors representing
    different field attributes.

x3270.macros
x3270.macros.host1
x3270.macros.host2
    Defines a set of macros assigned to a pull-down menu that appears when
    connected to a host.  The syntax is similar to a keymap (an X11 translation
    table), except that rather than a keysym name, the left-hand side is a
    name that will appear on the menu.  Any single action can be specified
    on the right-hand side.

    Definitions of the form "x3270.macros.<xxx>" define the macros menu when
    connected to host <xxx>, which override the "x3270.macros" definitions.

x3270.menuBar		Default true
    If set to false, the menu bar will not be displayed at the top of the
    x3270 main window.  The three pull-down menus are still available, however,
    by pressing Ctrl and each of the mouse buttons.

x3270.modifiedSel	Default false
    When true in pseudo-color mode, modified fields appear in the "input"
    (light pen selectable) color.  When false, modified fields are displayed
    in the same colors as unmodified fields.

x3270.model		Default 4		Switch -model
			Options Model 2
			        Model 3
			        Model 4
			        Model 5
    The 3278 terminal model that x3270 is emulating, which determines the
    size of the screen.

x3270.mono		Default false		Switch -mono
    If set to true, x3270 will operate in monochrome mode, even if it is
    running on a color display.

x3270.noOther		Default false
    If set to true, the "Other" options are disabled for selecting fonts
    and connecting to hosts, limiting users to the options provided on
    the menus.

x3270.oerrLock		Default true
    If set to true, operator errors (typing into protected fields, insert
    overflow, etc.) will cause the keyboard to lock with an error message
    on the status line.  If set to false, the terminal bell will ring,
    without any keyboard lock or message.

x3270.once		Default false		Switch -once
    When true, x3270 will exit as soon as a host disconnects.

x3270.oversize					Switch -oversize
    Sets the screen dimensions to be larger than the default for the
    chosen model.  Its value is a string in the format "COLSxROWS".  It is
    used only if "x3270.extended" or "x3270.m3279" are "true", and if the
    specified dimensions are larger than the model defaults.  Also, only
    hosts that support the Query Reply structured field will function
    properly with x3270 in this mode.

x3270.port		Default telnet		Switch -port
    The name of the default TCP port for x3270 to connect to.  This can be
    either a symbolic name from /etc/services, or an integer.

x3270.saveLines		Default 64		Switch -sl
    The number of display lines to save for the scroll bar.

x3270.scripted		Default false		Switch -scripted
    When true, x3270 will read commands from standard input.  The rules for
    these commands are documented in x3270script(1).

x3270.secure		Default false
    When true, x3270 will prevent users from executing arbitrary commands
    from within the program.  In particular, the "Execute Action" menu
    option is disabled, as are the pop-ups which allow editing the commands
    for "Print Screen Text" and "Print Window Bitmap".  See the x3270.noOther
    resource for additional security options.

x3270.termName		Default IBM-327x-n	Switch -tn
    An alternate name to be sent in response to the host's "DO OPTION
    TERMINAL-NAME" request.  The default is IBM-327x-n[-E], where x is either
    8 or 9 (depending on whether x3270 is in pseudo-color or full-color mode)
    n is the model number, and the "-E" is appended if the x3270.extended
    resource is true.

x3270.traceDir		Default /usr/tmp
    Defines the directory that data stream traces and screen images are saved
    in.

x3270.typeahead		Default true
    When true, x3270 will store keystrokes in a buffer when the keyboard is
    locked.  When false, these keystrokes will be dropped.

x3270.useCursorColor	Default false
    If set to false, the cursor is drawn using the same color as the text
    behind it.  If set to true, on color displays the cursor is drawn with
    the color specified by the x3270.cursorColor resource.

x3270.visualBell	Default false
    When true, x3270 will flash the screen in response to an ALARM WCC or
    BELL character, rather than ringing the X display's bell.

x3270.fontList		Default: 3270 Font: 3270
				 3270-12 Font: 3270-12
				 Debug Font: 3270d
    The list of menu labels and font names that appear on the Options menu.
    The first name on the list is used as the default emulator font.

x3270.resizeFontList	Default: 3270 3279-12 3270gt8
				 3270gt16 3270gt24 3270gt32
    The list of fonts used to resize the window in response to a mouse
    (window manager) request.

x3270.aplFont		Default	3270-apl
    The font used when in apl mode (when the -apl switch is used).  It is
    assumed that this is a 3270 font (one with the same ordering as 3270 and
    3270-12), but with special APL characters in place of accented (ISO
    Latin-1) characters.

x3270.debugFont		Default 3270d
    The name of the font recognized as the "debug" font.  (When x3270 thinks
    it is using a debug font, it uses a different, slower method to draw the
    screen.)  It is assumed that this is a 3270 font (one with the same
    ordering as 3270 and 3270-12), but with printable graphics in place of
    the NULL and field attribute characters, which are normally blank.

    Usually, the "Debug Font" menu option selects this font.

x3270.iconFont		Default nil2
    The font used to paint the text inside the active icon.  "nil2" is a
    one-by-two pixel font that produces a "greeked" picture of the screen
    image.

x3270.iconLabelFont 	Default 8x13
    When activeIcon and labelIcon are true, this is the name of the font used
    to paint the icon label.

x3270*keyPad*large*font	Default fixed
    The font used to paint the "large" labels on the keys in the keypad, i.e.,
    the PA and PF keys.

x3270*keyPad*small*font	Default -*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
    The font used to paint the "small" labels on the keys in the keypad, e.g.,
    the "Mono Case" key.

x3270*value*font	Default fixed
    The is the name of the font used for the input fields in data entry
    pop-ups.

x3270*dataLabel.font	Default -*-terminal-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
    The font used to display values in the "About x3270" pop-up.

x3270*font:		Default -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
    The font used for everything else.

x3270.traceCommand	Default tail -f
    The command that is run in the trace monitor window, with its standard
    input redirected from the trace file.  If given the value 'none', no
    monitor window will be created.

x3270.printTextCommand	Default lpr
    The shell command used by the PrintText action.  An ASCII image of the
    3270 display becomes the standard input to this command.  If the first
    character of the command is '@', the usual pop-up windows before and after
    the text is printed will not appear.

x3270.printWindowCommand	Default xwd -id %d | xpr | lpr
    The shell command used by the PrintWindow action.  The X window identifier
    of the main x3270 window is substituted for any "%d" in the command.  If
    the first character of the command is '@', the usual pop-up windows before
    and after the window is printed will not appear.

x3270.keypad.keyHeight	Default 24
    The height in pixels of all of the buttons on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.keyWidth	Default 48
    The width in pixels of the lower tier of buttons on a horizontal keypad.

x3270.keypad.pfWidth	Default 32
    The width in pixels of PF keys on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.paWidth	Default 36
    The width in pixels of PA and cursor keys on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.largeKeyWidth	Default 56
    The width in pixels of the lower tier of buttons on a vertical keypad.

x3270.baselevelTranslations
    The default translation table for the main window and keypad.  This may
    be modified with great care, however, it makes more sense to use keymaps
    to accomplish customizations.

x3270*errorPopup.title
