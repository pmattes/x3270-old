The original work was 3270tool, a 3270 emulator for Suntools (Sun's old
proprietary windowing environment).  This was developed by Robert Viduya at
Georgia Tech, and is why GTRC's copyright notice is first.

3270tool was then ported to X11R4 by Jeff Sparkes, and given the name "x3270."
This is why his name is second.

x3270 3.0 started with Jeff's x3270 version 1.2, and was made very much bigger
by Paul Mattes, with contributions and suggestions by a number of users from
the net.  This is the version you are looking at right now.

Given the spirit of creativity on the net (and the availability of source
code) there are a number of other versions of x3270, all based on Jeff's code,
most notably v1.2-cutpaste-iso8859-1 and v2.65.  x3270 3.0.2 is a separate line
of development from these other versions.  Patches for those versions do not
apply to x3270 3.0.x, and some of the features found in those versions may not
be in 3.0.x.  X resource definitions may not be compatible, either.
