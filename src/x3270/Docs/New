x3270 Version 3.1.1 -- New Features and Bug Fixes

x3270 3.1.1.9 is functionally identical to x3270 3.1.0.7, with the
following exceptions:

IND$FILE File Transfer Support

File transfer with IBM hosts is now supported using the IND$FILE protocol.
A new File menu item, File Transfer, initiates a transfer.

The IND$FILE program must be installed on the IBM host, and the 3270 cursor
must be positioned on a field which can accept a TSO or VM/CMS command.

A pop-up menu allows the file names and transfer options to be specified.

Both types of file transfer are supported and automatically recognized:
CUT, expanding the data into displayable characters a screenful at a time,
and DFT, exchanging binary data with Structured Fields.

This code was created in collaboration with Dick Altenbern.
