<H1>x3270 Build and Install Instructions</H1>

<H2>Vanilla X11R5 or X11R6</H2>

x3270 was developed on a Sun workstation running SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and MIT X11R5.
It is set up to build and install without modifications under any complete
X11R5 or X11R6 implementation.
<P>
A "complete" R5 or R6 implementation means that xmkmf and imake are configured
and installed on your system, and that the Xaw and Xmu libraries and header
files are installed.  Some vendors (HP and IBM in particular) consider these
optional software and do not always install them.
<P>
If you are running vanilla X11R5 or X11R6, then the build procedure is:
<P>
<PRE>
    xmkmf		# create a Makefile
    make depend		# add dependency information
    make		# build x3270 and its fonts
</PRE>
<P>
x3270 requires that its fonts and app-defaults file be installed in order to
run.  However, a script is provided for testing a local copy of x3270 in the
current directory:
<P>
<PRE>
    ./dryrun		# test x3270
</PRE>
<P>
Once you are satisfied that x3270 is working, you can install it (as root)
with the command:
<P>
<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>
<P>
Before running x3270, you will also need to (once):
<P>
<PRE>
    xset fp rehash
</PRE>
<P>
That's the easy way.  Here are the exceptions:

<H2>Vanilla X11R4</H2>

If you are running MIT X11R4 (subject to the same definition of "completeness"
above), the build procedure is almost as simple:
<P>
<PRE>
    mv Imakefile.R4 Imakefile	# use the R4 Imakefile instead
    xmkmf			# create a Makefile
    make depend			# add dependency information
    make			# build x3270 and its fonts
</PRE>
<P>
x3270 requires that its fonts and app-defaults file be installed in order to
run.  However, a script is provided for testing a local copy of x3270 in the
current directory:
<P>
<PRE>
    ./dryrun		# test x3270
</PRE>
<P>
Once you are satisfied that x3270 is working, you can install it (as root)
with the command:
<P>
<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>
<P>
Before running x3270, you will also need to (once):
<P>
<PRE>
    xset fp rehash
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>IBM RS/6000, AIX 3.2, X11R5</H2>

AIX X11R5 does not include does not include xmkmf or imake, but it includes
the source code for them.  If these have not been built and installed on
your system (e.g., if there is no such file as "/usr/bin/X11/imake"), you must
first build and install them by following the instructions in
/usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/README.
<P>
Once these have been installed, you can use the standard X11R5 build procedure
above.

<H2>IBM RS/6000, AIX 3.2, X11R4</H2>

AIX X11R4 does not include the Xaw libraries by default, and it does not
include xmkmf at all.  If the "Xample" clients and libraries have not been
installed on your system (e.g., if there is no such file as
"/usr/bin/X11/imake"), you must first build and install them by following the
instructions in /usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/README.
<P>
Once these have been installed, you can use a simple variation on the R4 build
procedure:
<P>
<PRE>
    mv Imakefile.R4 Imakefile	# use the R4 Imakefile instead
    imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/config	# replacement for xmkmf
    make depend			# add dependency information
    make			# build x3270 and its fonts
</PRE>
<P>
x3270 requires that its fonts and app-defaults file be installed in order to
run.  However, a script is provided for testing a local copy of x3270 in the
current directory:
<P>
<PRE>
    ./dryrun		# test x3270
</PRE>
<P>
Once you are satisfied that x3270 is working, you can install it (as root)
with the command:
<P>
<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>
<P>
Before running x3270, you will also need to (once):
<P>
<PRE>
    xset fp rehash
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>HP-UX A9.01, X11R5</H2>

HP's X11R5 distribution does not include the Xaw libraries or header files.  As
HP's X man page says,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    A number of unsupported core MIT clients and miscellaneous utilities
    are provided in /usr/contrib/bin.  In addition, the entire core MIT
    distribution, compiled for Hewlett-Packard platforms, can be obtained
    from HP's users group INTERWORKS for a nominal fee.  See the release
    notes for details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
What you need is the Xaw and Xmu libraries, imake, and xmkmf.  Then you can
follow the vanilla R5 build and install instructions.

<H2>Sun Solaris 2.3, OpenWindows Version 3.3 or Later</H2>

Surprise!  Sun has given up on the xnews server and proprietary font scheme,
and OpenWindows 3.3 is based on plain old X11R5.  Follow the instructions for
Vanilla X11R5.
<P>
However, Sun's X11 configuration files can still cause some problems.  These
are not x3270 problems -- they affect building any X application that uses an
Imakefile.
<P>
If you see compler errors like this:
<P>
<PRE>
    ucbcc: Warning: Option -Wa,-cg92 passed to ld, if ld is invoked, ignored otherwise
</PRE>
<P>
Then you need to to edit the "Makefile" that was produced by xmkmf and change
the line that reads:
<P>
<PRE>
    CCOPTIONS = -DSYSV -DSVR4 -xF -Wa,-cg92
</PRE>
<P>
and change it to:
<P>
<PRE>
    CCOPTIONS = -DSYSV -DSVR4 -xF
</PRE>
<P>
If "make install" fails with the following error:
<P>
<PRE>
    sh: /usr/openwin/bin/bsdinst: not found
</PRE>
<P>
Then edit the "Makefile" again and change the line that reads:
<P>
<PRE>
    INSTALL = $(BINDIR)/bsdinst
</PRE>
<P>
and change it to:
<P>
<PRE>
    INSTALL = /usr/ucb/install
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>Sun OpenWindows, Version 3.0, 3.1, or 3.2</H2>

Early versions of Sun OpenWindows use a proprietary font format that renders
standard Imakefiles useless.  A special Makefile is included in the x3270
distribution to handle this.  (NOTE: The special Makefile must be run with Sun
make; Gnu make will not work).
<P>
To build x3270:
<P>
<PRE>
    make -f Makefile.openwin
</PRE>
<P>
If you get the following undefineds:
<PRE>
   _get_wmShellWidgetClass
   _get_applicationShellWidgetClass
</PRE>
<P>
This is a bug in Sun's X11 libraries, and can be corrected by obtaining
patches 100512-02 and 100573-03 from Sun.  As a short-term workaround,
there is a line in Makefile.openwin which you can uncomment.
<P>
Note:  When the fonts are being compiled, the "bldfamily" program will produce
output lines that look like:
<PRE>
    * 3270                 ./3270.ff (Encoding: unknown)
</PRE>
These "unknown" messages are harmless.
<P>
x3270 requires that its fonts and app-defaults file be installed in order to
run.  However, a script is provided for testing a local copy of x3270 in the
current directory:
<P>
<PRE>
    ./dryrun		# test x3270
</PRE>
<P>
To install:
<P>
<PRE>
    make -f Makefile.openwin install
</PRE>
<P>
Before running x3270, you will also need to (once):
<P>
<PRE>
    xset fp rehash
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>Sun OpenWindows, Version 2</H2>

OpenWindows 2 does not include the the Athena Widgets (Xaw) or Xmu libraries,
so x3270 cannot run under it.

<H2>Systems Based on System V, Release 4</H2>

Before running xmkmf, you must uncomment a line in the Imakefile to include
the network libraries:
<PRE>
  EXTRA_LIBRARIES = -lnsl -lsocket
</PRE>

<H2>Mixed X Environments</H2>

If you are running a mixture of X environments, such as running a Sun XNews
server but using X11R5 libraries and header files, the supplied Imakefile
may not work properly, because it assumes that your server and libraries are
of the same type.  This is not an impossible situation, just a difficult one.
It generally means that you will have to build and install the fonts
separately, perhaps even by hand, and you may have to install the app-defaults
file by hand.
<P>
Some tools are available to help.  If you need to build fonts for an XNews
(Sun OpenWindows) server, but otherwise are using X11R4 or X11R5 libaries to
build x3270, you can build and install OpenWindows fonts separately with the
commands:
<P>
<PRE>
    make -f Makefile.openwin fonts
    make -f Makefile.openwin install.fonts
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>Building Fonts for X Terminals</H2>

The Imakefile that comes with x3270 assumes that you plan to run the x3270
client on the same workstation as your X server.  Therefore it builds fonts
for that kind of X server.  Compiled fonts (.snf or .pcf files) are not
compatible between different servers, so if you run x3270 with its display
somewhere else (such as on an X Terminal), you will need to compile the fonts
for that server.  It is impossible to give comprehensive instructions here;
however, here is an outline for how to do it:
<UL>
    Copy all of the .bdf files from the x3270 distribution into a new
     directory, say XXX.
<P>
    cd into XXX.
<P>
    For each .bdf file, run the server-specific version of bdftosnf to
     create a .snf file.  For example, for to build an NCD font on a
     Sun-4, the command is:
<PRE>
	/usr/local/NCD/binSun4/bdftosnf 3270.bdf >3270.snf
</PRE>
    Run the server-specific version of mkfontdir.  For example:
<PRE>
	/usr/local/NCD/binSun4/mkfontdir .
</PRE>
    Then tell your X server to use this directory:
<PRE>
	xset fp+ XXX
	xset fp rehash
</PRE>
</UL>
<H2>SCO Open Desktop 3</H2>
You will need to edit a few files in order to build under SCO Open Desktop 3.
<P>
In globals.h, remove the "#define NO_SYS_TIME_H" that is defined for sco.
<P>
In Imakefile, add:
<PRE>
	EXTRA_LIBRARIES = -lnsl_s -lsocket
</PRE>
Also be aware that x3270 requires the Athena Widgets library, which is
available from sosco.sco.com.
