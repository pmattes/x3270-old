Known Bugs in x3270 3.0.2

Pull-down menus do not work if the Shift, Meta, Alt or Caps Lock keys are down.
Specifically, the menus will drop down, but nothing can be selected.  This is a
bug in the Athena menu widget, and affects other programs such as 'bitmap' as
well.

When the -mono switch is used on a color display, the cursor is green.
