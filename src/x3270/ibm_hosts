# Sample x3270 ibm_hosts file.
#
# The format of each entry is:
#
#   name type [prefix]hostname[/port] [loginstring]
#
# where
#
#	name		is a name you wish to give to the host.  This name
#			can be used on the x3270 command line, and is the
#			name that will appear on the x3270 "Connect" menu.
#
#	type		is one of two keywords.  The value "primary" means
#			the entry will appear on the "Connect" menu.  The
#			value "alias" means it will not.
#
#	hostname	is the hostname or Internet address of the host to
#			to connect to.  It can be preceded by a prefix such
#			as "s:" or "p:" (see the x3270 man page), and it can
#			be followed by a slash and a port number to a port
#			other than the x3270 default (usually "telnet").
#
#	loginstring	is a string to send to the host as soon as the
#			connection is made and a data-entry field is defined.
#
localhost primary 127.0.0.1
