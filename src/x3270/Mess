The Resource Mess

The current hierarchy is this:
    1. app-defaults or fallbacks		system
    2. XAPPLRESDIR				system
    3. RESOURCE_MANAGER or .Xdefaults		system
    4. XENVIRONMENT or .Xdefaults-hostname	system
    5. -xrm					system
    6. 	<basics and messages>			explicit
    7. <profile>				explicit
    8. -xrm again				explicit

First, I would like to have resources dependent on -mono mode.
I could perhaps do an explicit XOpenDisplay() and find out if it is
monochrome, but this won't catch the -mono switch until it is too late.
We can catch the switch explicitly, of course, in which case it is just
the resource that will be ignored.  No biggie.

Second, the easiest way to do this is to build all of the app-defaults into
the program as fallbacks, but to break the app-defaults into sections
(basics, messages, local) that could be modified separately.  But this is
silly, it could just as easily be done with comments in the file.

Third, the user profile could be added to the fallbacks, with no need to
explicitly merge them.  This would cause .Xdefaults to override the profile,
which is not what we want.  So nix this idea.
