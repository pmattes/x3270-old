look into jeff's cut and paste problem -- just reproduced accidentally, but I
can't see how it gets wedged that way.  One window thinks he owns the selection
when he doesn't, and doesn't think he needs to get it back.

... functionality freeze 4/26/94 ...

look into 6k window print problem (xwd -id xxx) -- also can't reproduce

Later...

Structured fields.
Make scrollbars work in 3270 mode.
---
Add an Enter key to the keypad, maybe.
Add numeric-field-override key (next char only, or till reset).
Investigate OpenWindows' "Dismiss" on popups -- document as a known problem,
 at least.  It works on duluth.
Macros menu pinup.
Variable substitutions in macros.
Tilde expansions in file names.
Typeahead.
Think about automagic macro recording... <Play> <PFn>  (to where?)
Look into XtGetSubResources.
Look into an icon that reflects keyboard-lock state (Gary Speechley).
