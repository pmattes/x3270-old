Design for Combining MoveCursor and select-start

There will be a new action, move-select, which is equivalent to the old
select-start.  It will combine MoveCursor and select-start, and is intended to
be bound to !<Btn1Down>.

Its behavior will be:

    - If a region is selected, unselect it.  Otherwise...

    - First click down: Remember where the the cursor was and move the cursor.
      Also, do the usual actions for select-start.

    - Motion (select-extend): They didn't want to move the cursor.  Move the
      cursor back, then do the usual motion action.  [Should we differentiate
      between Btn3Down and BtnXMotion here?]

    - Second click up: They didn't want to move the cursor.  Move it back, then
      do the usual double-click action.
