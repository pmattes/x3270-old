<h1>
x3270 Build and Install Instructions</h1>

<h2>
Vanilla X11R6 or X11R5</h2>
<i>x3270</i> is set up to build and install without modifications under
any complete X11R6 or X11R5 implementation.
<p>A "complete" R6 or R5 implementation means that <i>xmkmf</i> and <i>imake</i>
are configured and installed on your system, and that the <tt>Xaw</tt>
and <tt>Xmu</tt> libraries and header files are installed. Some vendors
(HP, IBM, SCO) consider these optional software and do not always install
them.
<p>If you are running vanilla X11R6 or X11R5, then the build procedure
is to ensure that your X11 <tt>bin</tt> directory is in your <tt>$PATH</tt>,
then:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # probe for system dependencies and create the Imakefile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmkmf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # create a Makefile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make depend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # add dependency information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # build x3270 and its fonts</pre>
<i>x3270</i> prefers that its fonts be installed in order to run. However,
a script is provided for testing a local copy of <i>x3270</i> in the current
directory:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./dryrun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # test x3270</pre>
Once you are satisfied that <i>x3270</i> is working, you can install it
(as root) with the command:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make install</pre>
Before running <i>x3270</i>, you will also need to (once):
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xset fp rehash</pre>
That's the easy way. Here are the exceptions:
<h2>
IBM RS/6000, AIX 4.3.3 and 4.2.1</h2>
There is a bug in the <tt>X11.tmpl</tt> file in the X11 config directory,
which causes the <tt>Makefile</tt> produced by <i>imake</i> to have an
extra <tt>@</tt> character in it.
<p>After running <i>xmkmf</i>, edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> and change:
<blockquote><tt>@@for</tt></blockquote>
to:
<blockquote><tt>@for</tt></blockquote>
(there's only one).
<h2>
IBM RS/6000, AIX 3.2, X11R5</h2>
AIX X11R5 does not include does not include <i>xmkmf</i> or <i>imake</i>,
but it includes the source code for them. If these have not been built
and installed on your system (<i>e.g.</i>, if there is no such file as
<tt>/usr/bin/X11/imake</tt>),
you must first build and install them by following the instructions in
<tt>/usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/README</tt>.
<p>Once these have been installed, you can use the standard X11R5 build
procedure above.
<h2>
HP-UX A9.01, X11R5</h2>
HP's X11R5 distribution does not include the <tt>Xaw</tt> libraries or
header files. As HP's X man page says,
<blockquote>A number of unsupported core MIT clients and miscellaneous
utilities are provided in /usr/contrib/bin. In addition, the entire core
MIT distribution, compiled for Hewlett-Packard platforms, can be obtained
from HP's users group INTERWORKS for a nominal fee. See the release notes
for details.</blockquote>
What you need is the <tt>Xaw</tt> and <tt>Xmu</tt> libraries, <i>imake</i>,
and <i>xmkmf</i>. Then you can follow the vanilla R5 build and install
instructions.
<h2>
Sun Solaris 2.x</h2>
Follow the instructions for Vanilla X11R6, with the following changes.
<p><b>Do not use</b> Sun's "BSD-compatibility" C compiler, <tt>/usr/ucb/cc</tt>.
This is good advice in general, and in particular, <i>x3270</i> will not
build under it. Unfortunately, if you have installed Sun's unbundled C
compiler, and have
<tt>/usr/ucb</tt> in your $PATH ahead of <tt>/usr/ccs/bin</tt>,
then you will get <tt>/usr/ucb/cc</tt> by default. The fix is to install
<tt>gcc</tt>
(much preferred) or to have <tt>/usr/ccs/bin</tt> ahead of
<tt>/usr/ucb</tt>
in your $PATH.
<p>If you are using <i>gcc</i>, then Sun's <i>xmkmf</i> configuration puts
some compiler flags in the <tt>Makefile</tt> that are specific to Sun's
unbundled C compiler, and you may get a number of harmless, but annoying
error messages while compiling. To eliminate these, use the command:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make CDEBUGFLAGS=-O "CCOPTIONS=-DSYSV -DSVR4"</pre>
To run <i>x3270</i>, you must have your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment
variable set properly. First, it must include <tt>/usr/openwin/lib</tt>.
<h2>
Mixed X Environments</h2>
If you are running a mixture of X environments, such as running a Sun XNews
server but using X11R6 libraries and header files, the supplied <tt>Imakefile</tt>
may not work properly, because it assumes that your server and libraries
are of the same type. This is not an impossible situation, just a difficult
one. It generally means that you will have to build and install the fonts
separately, perhaps even by hand.
<h2>
Building Fonts for X Terminals</h2>
The Imakefile that comes with x3270 assumes that you plan to run the x3270
client on the same workstation as your X server. Therefore it builds fonts
for that kind of X server. Compiled fonts (.snf or .pcf files) are not
compatible between different servers, so if you run x3270 with its display
somewhere else (such as on an X Terminal), you will need to compile the
fonts for that server. It is impossible to give comprehensive instructions
here; however, here is an outline for how to do it:
<ul>Copy all of the <tt>.bdf</tt> files from the <i>x3270</i> distribution
into a new directory, say <tt>XXX</tt>.
<p><i>cd</i> into <tt>XXX</tt>.
<p>For each <tt>.bdf</tt> file, run the server-specific version of <i>bdftosnf</i>
or <i>bdftopcf</i> to create a <tt>.snf</tt> or <tt>.pcf</tt> file. For
example, for to build an NCD font on a Sun-4, the command is:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/local/NCD/binSun4/bdftosnf 3270.bdf >3270.snf</pre>
Run the server-specific version of <i>mkfontdir</i>. For example:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/local/NCD/binSun4/mkfontdir .</pre>
Then tell your X server to use this directory:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xset fp+ XXX
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xset fp rehash</pre>
</ul>

<h2>
SCO Open Desktop 3</h2>
<i>x3270</i> requires the Athena Widgets library, which is available from
sosco.sco.com.
<h2>
Using an app-defaults File</h2>
Earlier versions of <i>x3270</i> required a separate <b>app-defaults</b>
file. The app-defaults file contains definitions for options, text strings,
fonts, colors, etc. The file allows <i>x3270</i> to be reconfigured without
recompiling by simply editing the file.
<p>Unfortunately, using an app-defaults file is a pain. The mechanism for
finding the file is so flexible as to be almost incomprehensible, and it
is difficult to run the program without doing a full installation, requiring
root access to your system. Also, the app-defaults file generally changes
whenever the program changes, and making sure that <i>x3270</i> finds the
<b>correct</b>
app-defaults file compounds the above problems.
<p>Starting with version 3.1.0.0, <i>x3270</i> no longer uses a separate
app-defaults file. Instead, the file is compiled into <i>x3270</i> itself.
If however, you prefer to have a separate app-defaults file, you can compile
<i>x3270</i> to use it.
<p>First, you must decide whether you want app-defaults for a color display
or a monochrome display. For a color display, the commands are:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure --enable-app-defaults
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmkmf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make</pre>
For a monochrome display, the commands are:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure --enable-app-defaults=-UCOLOR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmkmf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make</pre>
