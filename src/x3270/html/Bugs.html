Known Bugs in x3270 3.2.14</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Crash in Keymap Display</b></li>

<br>There has been a report of a crash when the OK button is pressed in
the <b>Options->Display Current Keymap</b> pop-up.&nbsp; This problem does
not occur on most platforms.&nbsp; It is under
<br>investigation; if anyone can shed additional light on it, please let
me know.
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Host Session Hangs</b></li>

<br>Several users have reported a problem where the session hangs during
initialization -- immediately after x3270 has sent a Query Reply. I need
more information about this problem in order to debug it.
<br>The best information would be a TCP packet trace of a successful session
with a different emulator.&nbsp; Help!
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>User Area Too Small</b></li>

<br>A problem has been reported where a host application reports:
<ol><tt>000A1 You cannot use PM30 on terminal&nbsp; BG18 user area is too
small.</tt></ol>
This problem does not occur with other emulators.&nbsp; If anyone can shed
any light on this problem, I would appreciate it.</ol>
