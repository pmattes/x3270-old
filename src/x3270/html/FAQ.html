<h1>x3270, c3270, wc3270, s3270, tcl3270 and pr3287 Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

If you have a problem building, installing, or running
one of the programs in the <b class=bluer>x3270</b> suite,
please browse through this file first.

<H2>General Questions</H2>

<H3>wc3270 includes <b>mkshort.exe</b>.  Isn't that some sort of keylogger?</H3>

The program called <b>mkshort.exe</b> that is installed with <b>wc3270</b> is
<i>not</i> spyware -- it's a little utility program that is used to create
the desktop shortcuts when <b>wc3270</b> is installed.
Unfortunately, it has the same name as a very bad program.
<p>
You can safely remove <b>mkshort.exe</b> from the <b>wc3270</b> installation
directory; it is not needed once <b>wc3270</b> is installed.
</p>
<p>
<b>mkshort.exe</b> will be removed (or at least renamed) in a future release
of <b>wc3270</b>.

<H3>How do I change the keyboard mapping?</H3>

Look at the <A HREF="Keymap.html">x3270 Keymap</A> document,
the <a href="c3270Keymap.html">c3270 Keymap</a> document or the
<a href="wc3270Keymap.html">wc3270 Keymap</a> document.

<h3>Why can't I map the Alt, Ctrl or Shift keys in c3270?</h3>

That's because <b class=bluer>c3270</b> runs on dumb
terminals, not on graphics displays.
<p>
c3270 can only respond to keys that generate input on a TTY device, and it can
only respond differently to combinations of keys that generate different input
on a TTY device.
</p>
<p>
Most dumb terminals -- and that includes the Linux console -- do not generate
any TTY input at all when the Alt, Ctrl or Shift keys are pressed.
They generate input only when another key is pressed in combination with
one of those keys.
In addition, there is nothing in the input that indicates that the Alt or
Shift key was pressed in combination with a key.
The presence of the Ctrl key can be inferred by the ASCII code that is
generated (the Ctrl key subtracts 0x20 from the ASCII value of the key without
Ctrl).
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, most terminals generate exactly the same TTY input for a given
function key (F1..F12), whether or not Shift, Ctrl or Alt are pressed.
This is complicated by the fact that the <i>curses</i> library, which is what
<b class=bluer>c3270</b> uses to do its I/O, does not even
provide a way to convey such an event to
<b class=bluer>c3270</b> -- there is a "Function Key 1"
event, but no "Shifted Function Key 1" event and no "Alt Function Key 1" event.
</p>

<h3>Is there a Windows version?</h3>

Yes!
<p>First, there is <b class=bluer>wc3270</b>, the native Windows console
version of <b class=bluer>c3270</b>.</p>
<p>Second, <b class=bluer>x3270</b> and
<b class=bluer>c3270</b> compile and run under Cygwin,
the free Unix emulator for Windows.
(In fact, they are standard packages with more recent versions of Cygwin).
You can get Cygwin <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>
If disk space is a concern, you can run
<b class=bluer>c3270</b> with a minimal set of
Cygwin DLLs and one text file -- there is no need to install all of Cygwin.
</p>
<p>
Note that there is not a native Win32 port of x3270, nor are there concrete
plans for one.
</p>

<H3>Why are the <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> characters displayed wrong?</H3>

    Look at the <A HREF="Brackets.html">Brackets</A> document.

<H2>Fatal Errors From 'make'</H2>

<H3>Make reports: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `FontObj(3270)'.</H3>

    This generally means that you are running X11R4, rather than X11R5 or
    X11R6.
    <b class=bluer>x3270</b>
    does not run under X11R4.

<h2>Other Problems</h2>

<H3>x3270 Isn't Using the 3270 Font</H3>

One of the trickier areas;
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
uses its own fonts to replicate a
life-like IBM 3270.  This is not fatal, however;
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
can use any fixed-width X font.
If it can't find its own font, it defaults to "fixed".
<P>
    The simplest probem to fix is that you haven't told your X server that
    there are new fonts it can use.  This is corrected with:
<PRE>
    xset fp rehash
</PRE>
    If this doesn't help, it is possible that your X server font path doesn't
    include the directory that the 3270 fonts were installed in.  Run the
    command "xset q".  The output will include an entry like:
<PRE>
    Font Path:
      /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/
</PRE>
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>'s fonts are usually installed in /usr/local/fonts.  If this
    (or some variation on it) does not appear in the "xset q" output, you can
    try:
<PRE>
    xset fp+ /usr/local/fonts/
    xset fp rehash
</PRE>

<H3>x3270 isn't paying any attention to my keymap definition.</H3>

There are two likely causes for this problem: either
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
isn't seeing
    your keymap definition, or there is something wrong with the definition
    itself.
<P>
You can tell exactly which keymap and keymap modifiers
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
is using with
    the "About x3270" option on the "Options" menu.  There is an entry labeled
    "Keyboard map:" which lists the keymap(s) in effect.  If yours is missing,
    there are a number of possible causes:
<UL>
<LI>
There is a hierarchy of places that
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
looks for the keymap list,
      and the one you are assuming may not be the one it finds.  In the
      following list, earlier objects override those below:
<UL>
	<LI>The -keymap switch on the command line.
	<LI>The definition of "x3270.keymap" in your .Xdefaults file.
	<LI>The KEYMAP environment variable.
	<LI>The KEYBD environment variable.
</UL>
    <LI>You may have modified your .Xdefaults file, but not yet re-read the
      database.  You can either log off of X and start over, or you can run
      the command:
<PRE>
	xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults
</PRE>
    <LI>Beware that there are some subtle interactions between .Xdefaults and
      cpp on your system.  On a sun4 for example, cpp defines the symbol "sun"
      as "1", so a keymap definition for "sun-k4" becomes "1-k4".

    <LI>A keymap definition is in two parts, the name of the keymap and the
      definition of the keymap.  The "x3270.keymap" resource controls the name
      of the keymap; then for each keymap type "x" there must be an additional
      resourced named "x3270.keymap.x".  If this definition is missing,
      <b class=bluer>x3270</b>
      will not recognize the keymap.
<LI>
    One other cause of missed keymaps is the symbol "sun" defined by the
    C preprocessor.  If you have an entry in your .Xdefaults file that looks
    like:
<PRE>
	x3270.keymap: sun-k5
</PRE>
    then use xrdb to read in the file, the symbol "sun" may be defined as
    "1" as the file is read.  This turns the above into:
<PRE>
	x3270.keymap: 1-k5
</PRE>
    causing much confusion.
<P>
    The fix is to add the following line to the top of your .Xdefaults:
<PRE>
	#undef sun
</PRE>
</UL>
    If your keymap appears in the list, but doesn't seem to have any effect,
    the causes are probably more subtle.  Keymap definitions (X translation
    tables) are an object of study in themselves; the O'Reilly books (volume 4
    in particular) are your best guide here, along with a thorough reading of
    the "Resources" document.

<H3>The "Alt" key doesn't work.</H3>

    If the "A" appears on the status line when you press the Alt key, but
    none of the key mappings that use Alt seem to work (i.e., the APL keys),
    perhaps your X server isn't configured with Alt as a modifier.  Try
    the following xmodmap command:
<PRE>
	xmodmap -e 'add Mod2 = Alt_L'
</PRE>
    If this fixes the problem, you can add it to your .xinitrc file, so it
    takes effect every time your start X.

<H3>x3270 is misbehaving on a certain application.</H3>

If
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
produces a different display or interaction than a real 3270 or
some other emulator, it is entirely possible that
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
is at fault.
    What you can do to help debug it is to capture a trace of the session.
    The easiest way to do this is:
<PRE>
    x3270 -trace
</PRE>
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
will create a trace file in /tmp, which will contain a dump of
all of the data that
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
sent or received, along with its interpretation.
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
will also pop up a window to view the file while it is being created;
    the title of that window is the full pathname of the trace file.  If you
    are familiar with the 3270 Data Stream protocol, you may be able to figure
    out the problem yourself; otherwise, after suitable editing to remove
    passwords and proprietary information, you may send it in (see below).

<H3>I can't get Num Lock to work on my Sun keyboard.</H3>

    If you are using an X server based directly on the MIT distribution (the
    NumLock light does not turn on when you press the NumLock key), then you
    are pretty much stuck; your server does not support NumLock.  (However,
    you can get the keypad to produce numbers by holding down the Shift key.)

<H3>There is no termcap entry for "IBM-3278-xxx"</H3>

If you log into a non-IBM host with
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
your TERM variable will be
    set to "IBM-327x", which is not especially useful for running programs
    like vi.
<P>
    One solution is to set your TERM variable to "xterm" after you log in,
    and to set the number of lines and columns to match the current
    <b class=bluer>x3270</b>
    model number (this is done through the "stty" command or with environment
    variables, depending on your system).
<P>
    A second solution is to create termcap entries for the 3270 terminal
    types.  Here are some sample entries:
<PRE>
    I2|IBM-3278-2|x3270 Emulating 3278-2:li#24:tc=xterm:
    I3|IBM-3278-3|x3270 Emulating 3278-3:li#32:tc=xterm:
    I4|IBM-3278-4|x3270 Emulating 3278-4:li#43:tc=xterm:
    I5|IBM-3278-5|x3270 Emulating 3278-5:li#27:co#127:tc=xterm:
</PRE>

<H3>My screen isn't being drawn properly</H3>

    There is a bug in certain versions of the Linux Mach32 X server, which
    causes the
    <b class=bluer>x3270</b>
    screen to be drawn incompletely.  The screen image can
    be restored by iconifying and un-iconifying the window.
<P>
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
can be modified to work around this problem.  An unfortunate
    side-effect is that it will no longer be able to display APL characters,
    or line-drawing characters with any of the 3270 fonts.
<P>
To rebuild
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
to work around this bug, edit the Imakefile and add a
    line at the top:
<PRE>
    EXTRA_DEFINES = -DBROKEN_MACH32
</PRE>
Then rebuild the makefile, the module "screen.o", and
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>:
<PRE>
    rm screen.o
    xmkmf
    make depend
    make
</PRE>

<h3>The PF12 Key Doesn't Work on KDE</h3>
KDE reserves the F12 key for "Mouse Emulation", so
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
cannot use
this key.
To allow
<b class=bluer>x3270</b>
to use F12, pull up the KDE Control Center, look under
"Look & Feel", and under that, "Key Bindings".  Remove the binding for F12.
