<h1>New Features in x3270 3.3
<hr width="100%"></h1>
x3270 3.3 is the future development line for x3270. It is functionally equivalent
to x3270 3.2.20, with the addition of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) support
and DBCS (Double Byte Character Set) support for East Asian languages --
Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
<p>The DBCS work required a significant change in the internal workings of
x3270. For those familiar with the source code, the change was to store EBCDIC
codes internally, and to dispense with the confusing CG-code representation
of the 3270 display. This required changing all of the logic that manipulates
field attributes, as well as the logic that translates the host output, keyboard
input, and X11 display output.</p>
<p>A few eggs were broken in that process:</p>
<ul>
 <li>'Flipped' mode (for right-to-left languages) is disabled.</li>
 <li>pr3287 does not support DBCS.</li>
 <li>File Transfer does not handle DBCS characters properly.</li>
</ul>
And other bugs may yet lurk.
<p>However, once x3270 3.3 is stable enough and the broken features have
been corrected, it will replace x3270 3.2.</p>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.1alpha9, 24. July 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>DBCS character set names are displayed only when DBCS support is
       built into x3270.</li>
      <li>Removed the concept of 'per-host' resources.  Use profiles for
       this.</li>
      <li>Fixed idle commands.  They were pretty much hopeless in 3.3.1alpha8
       and 3.2.20.</li>
      <li>Fixed a Unicode conversion crash.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in processing the Modify Field order, which would cause
       the character set attribute for the field to be accidentally reset to
       the default.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>User-specified lists (character sets, hosts, fonts, color schemes)
       can now be organized into sub-lists.  The name <b>Bob>Fred>Tony</b>
       specifies that there is a sub-list called <b>Bob</b>, which contains a
       sub-list <b>Fred</b>, which contains the item <b>Tony</b>.</li>
       <li>The TELNET START-TLS option is now supported.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.1alpha8, 15. April 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Builds cleanly on Linux with <tt>-Wall -ansi -pedantic</tt>.</li>
    <li>Builds without OpenSSL libraries being present.</li>
    <li>Correctly records Field Attributes in the initial screen snapshot
in a Data Stream Trace file.</li>
    <li>Auto-Skip fields work properly.</li>
    <li>"Dead" positions in DBCS fields are handled correctly.</li>
    <li>Invalid host DBCS characters are handled better and are displayed
in the Data Stream Trace file.</li>
    <li>The <b>Erase</b> action now works properly with DBCS characters.</li>
    <li>The <b>Visible Control Characters</b> toggle now works properly.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>New Features:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>Erase</b> action is now the default for the <b>BackSpace</b>
key.</li>
    <li>Four more Japanese host code pages have been added: 930, 939, 1390
and 1399. This uses new support for combined SBCS/DBCS code pages.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.1, 14. February 2003</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:   
    <ul>
   <li>(Same as x3270 3.2.20)</li>
  
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>New Features:   
    <ul>
   <li>DBCS support for Simplfied Chinese and Japanese, including integration
    with XIM.</li>
   <li>Tunneled SSL support added (entire Telnet session inside of an SSL
    tunnel).  Uses the OpenSSL library.  Toggled with an 'l:' (ell) prefix
on     the hostname.</li>
   <li>A <i>Visible Control Characters</i> toggle replaces the 3270d Debug
    Font.</li>
   <li><b>About x3270</b> pop-up split into three smaller pieces.</li>
  
    </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
