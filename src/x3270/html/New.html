New Features in x3270 3.3
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>
x3270 3.3 is the future development line for x3270.
It is functionally equivalent to x3270 3.2.20, with the addition of DBCS
(Double Byte Character Set) support for East Asian languages -- Chinese,
Japanese and Korean.
<p>
The DBCS work required a significant change in the internal workings of
x3270.
For those familiar with the source code, the change was to store EBCDIC codes
internally, and to dispense with the confusing CG-code representation of the
3270 display.
This required changing all of the logic that manipulates field attributes,
as well as the logic that translates the host output, keyboard input, and
X11 display output.
<p>
A few eggs were broken in that process:
<ul>
 <li>The crosshair cursor does not always display properly.</li>
 <li>'Flipped' mode (for right-to-left languages) is broken in a number of
  ways.</li>
 <li)>pr3287 will not build.</li>
</ul>
And other bugs may yet lurk.
<p>
However, once x3270 3.3 is stable enough and the broken features have been
corrected, it will replace x3270 3.2.
