   <title>x3270 3.2 New Features</title>
</head>
<body>
<b>New Features in x3270 3.2</b>
<p>x3270 3.2 is a reorganization of x3270 3.1, with some additional enhancements.&nbsp;
It is intended to be the future development platform for x3270, with x3270
3.1 continued only with bug fixes.
<p><b>Internal Changes</b>
<br>The primary focus of the reorganzation is modularity. For example,
through the new <tt><font size=+1>parts.h</font></tt> header file, it is
now possible to build subsets of x3270, excluding one or more of the following
features:
<br>tracing
<ul>
<li>
ANSI mode</li>

<li>
Scripting</li>

<li>
Menu bar</li>

<li>
Pop-up keypad</li>

<li>
APL support</li>

<li>
X display</li>
</ul>
This can make for a much smaller footprint for limited applications, as
well as new applications based on components of x3270. For example, a new
program, s3270, is now available, which consists of only the 3270 protocol
engine and the scripting facility, allowing x3270 scripts to be run without
an X display.
<p>The code is also reorganized to reduce the amount of explicit coupling
between modules. An event registration mechanism is used to propagate state
changes, instead of explicit calls from one module to another.
<p>The code is now written in ANSI C, using function prototypes.
<p>Support for X11R4 has been dropped.
<p><b>External Changes</b>
<br>All operating modes can now be changed at runtime via menus, including
extended data stream mode, and 3277/3278/3279 emulation.
<p>The "Trace X Events" option has been replaced with a "Trace Keyboard
and Mouse Events" option, which reports only X events which can be mapped
with keymaps. It also reports the keymap that was used to map each action,
making keymap debug much easier.
<p>A menu option allows the current keymap to be displayed.
<p>A new <tt><font size=+1>base</font></tt> keymap is defined, containing
the default keyboard mappings.&nbsp; This keymap can be modified at will,
without interfering with the basic operation of x3270, or the processing
of X events not related to the keyboard or mouse (as was the case with
the previous default translations resource).
<p>Default keymaps are defined for several well-known keyboards. These
keymaps are automatically used when x3270 recognizes the vendor string
for the associated X server.
<p>Several x3270 bugs, which were in the "impossible to fix" category (because
of basic code organization problems) have finally been fixed.
