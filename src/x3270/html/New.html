</head>
<body>

<h1>
<b>New Features in x3270 3.2</b>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>
x3270 3.2 is a reorganization of x3270 3.1, with some significant enhancements.&nbsp;
It is intended to be the future development platform for x3270, with x3270
3.1 continued only with bug fixes.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.10, 5. July 2000</b></h2>
Added an <b>n:</b> prefix to hostnames to selectively disable TN3270E.
<br>Changed the reported CSCSGID to <tt>X'02B90025'</tt> (English-U.S.).
<br>Fixed the <b>Attn()</b> action to send TELNET IP, per RFC 2355.
<br>Removed the explicit <tt>$(BINDIR)</tt> from the <tt>Imakefile</tt>;
it bothered XFree86 4.0.
<br>Announce which font we're using when we can't find the one the user
asked for.
<br>Fixed the problem of ignoring keyboard input when the window manager
uses a click-to-focus policy and the mouse cursor is outside the x3270
window.
<br>When processing <tt>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</tt> ICCM messages, save toggles
before saving the hostname.
<br>Added a new <b>MoveCursorSelect()</b> action, to emulate light pen
selection with the mouse. The default mapping is <tt>Ctrl Shift &lt;Btn1Down></tt>.
<br>Added a <b>highlightSelect</b> resource (default <b>True</b>) to control
whether highlighted fields are selectable via the <b>CursorSelect()</b>
and <b>MoveCursorSelect()</b>.
<br>Added <b>visualSelect</b> and <b>visualSelectColor</b> resources to
optionally display light pen selectable fields in a different color.
<br>Allow spaces in font names.
<br>Removed <tt>XtSpecificationRelease</tt> dependencies.
<br>Added AIX "<tt>@@for</tt>" problem workaround to the build instructions.
<br>Restored the ability to disable most components in <tt>parts.h</tt>,
and made TN3270E mode a configurable component.
<br>Removed old <tt>ARGSUSED</tt> lint hints.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.9, 26. June 2000</b></h2>
Fixed requesting the wrong LU after switching between TN3270E and TN3270
modes.
<br>Changed the resource file format back to using "x3270" as a consistent
prefix. Changed <b>x3270.fontList</b> to <b>x3270.fontMenuList</b> to avoid
conflicts.
<br>Fixed a typo in the <tt>sun_k5</tt> keymap.
<br>Added a new <b>Snap()</b> action for scripts.
<br>Added new <b>Wait(Disconnect)</b> and <b>Wait(Output)</b> actions for
scripts.
<br>Changed <b>Wait()</b> to <b>Wait(InputField)</b>, <b>Wait(3270)</b>
to <b>Wait(3270Mode)</b> and <b>Wait(ansi)</b> to <b>Wait(NVTMode)</b>.
The old names are still supported for backwards-compatibility.
<br>Fixed a problem with parameter processing in the <b>Transfer()</b>
action.
<br>Improved script tracing.
<br>Added stricter enforcement of user-specified LUs.
<br>Fixed a nit in tracing Query Reply options.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.8, 1. June 2000</b></h2>
Fixed a problem with initial host connection negotation, when using a script
(x3270 -script, s3270 or tcl3270) and talking to a non-TN3270E host.
<br>Added lefttack and righttack definitions to the apl keymap.
<br>Added support for IND$FILE file transfers in scripts, via the new Transfer
action.
<br>Added a disconnectClear resource to control clearing the screen after
a host disconnect.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.7, 30. May 2000</b></h2>
Fixed a problem with compiling kybd.c on X11R5.
<br>Fixed a problem with the <b>util</b> library on Solaris and AIX.
<br>Fixed several problems with TN3270E SSCP-LU mode: garbled input to
the host, echoed input being overwritten by host output, and keyboard locking
inconsistencies.
<br>Fixed repetition of the contents of the <tt>ibm_hosts</tt> file in
the <b>Connect</b> menu.
<br>Removed the accidental substitution of the symbolic host name with
the resolved hostname in the <b>Connect</b> menu and the window title.
<br>Removed a spurious error on AIX about not being able to find the <tt>rs6000</tt>
keymap.
<br>Added the file <tt>localdefs.h</tt>, to better isolate X11 dependencies
for <b>s3270</b> and <b>tcl3270</b>.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.6, 19. May 2000</b></h2>
Fixed a problem with displaying TN3270E options in the "About" pop-up,
even if TN3270E mode had not been negotiated.
<br>Added Sharp APL characters <b>dieresisjot</b>, <b>dieresiscircle</b>,
<b>commabar</b>
and <b>euro</b>, as well as names for the APL-specific versions of <b>braceleft</b>
and <b>braceright</b>.
<br>Added cut-and-paste of EBCDIC DUP and FM characters.
<br>Changed x3270.man.html to x3270-man.html.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.5, 15. May 2000</b></h2>
Fixed a problem with scripts hanging in TN3270E SSCP-LU mode.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2.4, 8. May 2000</b></h2>
Functionally identical to x3270 3.2A3.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2A3, 2. May 2000</b></h2>
Added support for the Greek character set and a Greek font, <b>3270gr</b>.
<br>Fixed problems with font and color scheme checkboxes not being updated
in the menu bar.
<br>Fixed compiler warnings from not using <tt>time_t</tt>'s properly.
<br>Fixed a problem with the status line improperly reporting disconnections
during certain TN3270E mode switches.
<br>Added TN3270E state to the data stream trace data.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2A2, 27. April 2000</b></h2>
Due to problems with servers that do not support basic TN3270E, added support
for TN3270E options RESPONSES, SYSREQ and BIND-IMAGE.
<br>Removed disconnect logic when an invalid TN3270E message is received.
<br>Fixed a problem with ignoring the <tt>ibm_hosts</tt> file.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2A1, 9. December 1999</b></h2>
Added basic TN3270E support.
<h2>
<b>Changes in x3270 3.2A0, 15. March 1999</b></h2>

<h3>
<b>Internal Changes</b></h3>
The primary focus of the reorganzation is modularity. For example, through
the new <tt><font size=+1>parts.h</font></tt> header file, it is now possible
to build subsets of x3270, excluding one or more of the following features:
<ul>
<li>
Tracing</li>

<li>
ANSI mode</li>

<li>
Scripting</li>

<li>
Menu bar</li>

<li>
Pop-up keypad</li>

<li>
APL support</li>

<li>
X display</li>
</ul>
This can make for a much smaller footprint for limited applications, as
well as new applications based on components of x3270. For example, a new
program, <i>s3270</i>, is now available, which consists of only the 3270
protocol engine and the scripting facility, allowing x3270 scripts to be
run without an X display.
<p>The code is also reorganized to reduce the amount of explicit coupling
between modules. An event registration mechanism is used to propagate state
changes, instead of explicit calls from one module to another.
<p>The code is now written in ANSI C, using function prototypes and <tt>const</tt>
where appropriate.
<p>Support for X11R4 and K&amp;R C compilers has been dropped.
<h3>
<b>External Changes</b></h3>
Basic TN3270E is now supported. TN3270E printers are not supported.
<p>On systems that support the <i>forkpty</i>() library call (such as BSD-derived
systems and Linux), x3270 supports local processes.&nbsp; A local process
is a Unix process such as a shell which is connected to x3270 with a pty.&nbsp;
In this way, x3270 will function as a local terminal emulator like <i>xterm</i>.
<p>All operating modes can now be changed at runtime via menus, including
extended data stream mode, and 3277/3278/3279 emulation.
<p>The "Trace X Events" option has been replaced with a "Trace Keyboard
and Mouse Events" option, which reports only X events which can be mapped
with keymaps. It also reports the keymap that was used to map each action,
making keymap debug much easier.
<p>A menu option allows the current keymap to be displayed.
<p>A new <tt><font size=+1>base</font></tt> keymap is defined, containing
the default keyboard mappings.&nbsp; This keymap can be modified at will,
without interfering with the basic operation of x3270, or the processing
of X events not related to the keyboard or mouse (as was the case with
the previous default translations resource).
<p>Default keymaps are defined for several well-known keyboards. These
keymaps are automatically used when x3270 recognizes the vendor string
for the associated X server.
<p>Several x3270 bugs, which were in the "impossible to fix" category (because
of basic code organization problems) have finally been fixed.
