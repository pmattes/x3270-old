<H1>x3270 Version 3.1.1 -- New Features and Bug Fixes</H1>

x3270 3.1.1.6 is functionally identical to x3270 3.1.0.7, with the following
exceptions:
<H2>IND$FILE File Transfer Support</H2>
File transfer with IBM hosts is now supported using the IND$FILE protocol.
A new <B>File</B> menu item, <B>File Transfer</B>, initiates a transfer.
<P>The IND$FILE program must be installed on the IBM host, and the 3270
cursor must be positioned on a field which can accept a TSO or VM/CMS
command.
<P>A pop-up menu allows the file names and transfer options to be specified.
<P>Both types of file transfer are supported and automatically recognized:
<I>CUT</I>, expanding the data into displayable characters a screenful at a
time, and <I>DFT</I>, exchanging binary data with Structured Fields.
<P>This code was created in collaboration with Dick Altenbern.
