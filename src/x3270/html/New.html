<h1>New Features in x3270 3.3
<hr width="100%"></h1>
x3270 3.3 is the current development line for x3270.
It is functionally equivalent to x3270 3.2.20, with the addition of SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer) support and DBCS (Double Byte Character Set) support for East
Asian languages -- Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
<p>The DBCS work required a significant change in the internal workings of
x3270. For those familiar with the source code, the change was to store EBCDIC
codes internally, and to dispense with the confusing CG-code representation
of the 3270 display.
This required changing all of the logic that manipulates
field attributes, as well as the logic that translates the host output, keyboard
input, and X11 display output.</p>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.3, 31. December 2004</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed the <b>Transfer()</b> action, which didn't work at all.</li>
      <li>Fixed the default primary/alternate screen size (it was alternate,
       it's supposed to be primary).</li>
      <li>Fixed c3270 color support with ncurses and 80/132 screen-size
       switching.
       Sometimes only one of the screen sizes had color.</li>
      <li>Fixed a memory leak in pr3287 when the <b>-reconnect</b> option
       is used. (<i>Thanks to Marcelo Lemos for the fix.</i>)</li>
      <li>Fixed the output of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters in the
       <b>Ascii()</b> scripting action.
       These were formerly all output as blanks; now they are output in
       the same was as x3270 3.2.</li>
      <li>Fixed the display of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters when
       x3270 is using a 3270 font.</li>
      <li>Fixed the display of DBCS blanks, which sometimes displayed as
       'undefined' characters.</li>
      <li>Fixed DBCS character display with fonts whose maximum bounds are
       larger than their reported line-spacing bounds.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>make depend</b>.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which got confused when there was
       a whitespace-delimited double-quote in the emulator output.</li>
      <li>Fixed crashes when the entire File or Options menus were suppressed.
       </li>
      <li>Fixed a scripting hang when an UNBIND command arrived while an AID
       was pending.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with the incomplete processing of a NULLing Program
       Tab order, which could leave formatting artifacts on the screen.</li>
      <li>Removed &lt;subchar1&gt; clauses in two of the <b>.ucm</b> files
       that prevents later versions of ICU's <b>makeconv</b> from accepting
       them, and removed DOS carriage-return characters from the CP837
       <b>.ucm</b> file.</li>
      <li>Corrected some DFT-mode file upload problems: corrected the data
       length, and corrected an empty-buffer problem when the file size was
       an even multiple of the buffer size.</li>
      <li>Corrected a DBCS conversion problem with ICU 3.0.</li>
      <li>Added variable buffer-size support to DFT file transfers.</li>
      <li>Corrected a line-drawing character bug in c3270.</li>
      <li>Fixed a buffer overflow problem in the <b>ReadBuffer</b> action.</li>
      <li>Fixed garbage characters generated for APL data by the <b>Ascii</b>
       and <b>ReadBuffer</b> actions.</li>
      <li>Allow 0 timeouts in <b>Wait</b> actions.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added support for <i>dead</i> keys (acute, grave, circumflex, tilde,
      diaeresis) to the default keymap, and improved the Latin-1 compose
      map. (<i>Thanks to Marcelo Lemos for the change.</i>)</li>
     <li>Added new actions for improved mouse interactions, and made them the
      default.  Button 1 now moves the cursor, without the Shift key.</li>
      <li>Added support for DBCS in pr3287, but only when started from an
       x3270 session.</li>
     <li>Added Don Russel's RPQNAMES support.</li>
     <li>Removed Minolta-copyrighted code, because of licensing problems.</li>
     <li>Added an <b>aidWait</b> toggle to allow AID actions (<b>Clear</b>,
      <b>Enter</b>, <b>PA</b> and <b>PF</b>) to complete immediately without
      waiting for the host to unlock the keyboard, and a <b>Wait(Unlock)</b>
      action action to block a script until the keyboard is unlocked,
      regardless of the state of the new toggle.</li>
     <li>Turned off the old scripting hack the delayed actually unlocking the
      keyboard for 50ms after the host says we can unlock it.  Added a
      <b>unlockDelay</b> resource, which can be set to <b>true</b> to turn
      it back on.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>dftBufferSize</b> resource to set the default DFT
      buffer size.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>Save Screen Text</b> menu option to save the screen image
      in a file, optionally in HTML.</li>
     <li>Added options to the PrintText action to save to a file, to save HTML,
      and to return the text as script data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.2, 1. December 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected a screen-redraw crash when using <b>fixedSize</b> and
       <b>xim</b>.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem in <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which caused
       Tcl syntax errors if a string began with a dash. <i>Thanks to David
       Taylor for the fix.</i></li>  
      <li>Fixed a problem with DBCS input when using a single DBCS/SBCS
       character set.</li>
      <li>Made DBCS encoding recognition automatic wherever possible, leaving
       the <b>-km</b> option for cases when x3270 can't figure it out from the
       locale.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added support for Cyrillic keysyms to the <b>Default()</b>
      action.</li>
     <li>Added an 'unlocked' icon for unencrypted connections, if x3270 is
      built with SSL/TLS support.</li>
     <li>Error messages are now written to the trace file.</li>
     <li>The response to the TELNET TIMING MARK option has been changed to
      make it compatible with the majority of TELNET clients.
      The response to DO TIMING MARK is now WONT TIMING MARK.
      To restore the previous behavior (responding with WILL TIMING MARK,
      originally derived from the BSD TELNET client), set the resource
      <b>x3270.bsdTm</b> to <b>true</b>.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.1alpha10, 29. August 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Made nondisplay fields invisible to the <b>Ascii()</b> action.</li>
      <li>Corrected start-field values at the beginning of data stream traces
       and in the 3270 Read Buffer response.</li>
      <li>Corrected a tight loop in the macro error cancellation logic.</li>
      <li>Corrected a crash when connecting to a host and there is no menu
       bar visible.</li>
      <li>Corrected crashes in monochrome mode (<b>-mono</b>) and
       pseudo-color mode (<b>-model 3278</b>).
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added a <b>ReadBuffer()</b> action to dump the entire contents of
      the 3270 buffer, including field attributes and extended attributes.</li>
     <li>Added support for <b>suppress</b> resources for each menu item.
      If set to <b>True</b>, that menu item will not appear.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>suppressActions</b> resource, a list of the names of
      actions to disable.  This is primarily for controlled environments where
      the user does not have access to the <b>x3270</b> command line, but can
      edit keymap definitions.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>Setverbose</b> function to <tt>x3270_glue.expect</tt>
       to allow verbosity to be changed on the fly.
       <i>(Courtesy of David Taylor.)</i></li>
      <li>Added the ability to define resources in an environment variable,
       <b>$X3270RDB</b>.  The environment variable overrides values set in
       the profile file, but is overridden by command-line options.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>fixedSize</b> resource to force the <b>x3270</b> to a
       particular size.  <b>fixedSize</b> has the value
       <i>width</i><b>x</b><i>height</i>, in pixels.
       The 3270 display will float in the center of the window, if need
       be.</li>
      <li>Added a new keypad position (<b>x3270.keypad</b>):
       <b>insideRight</b>.  This positions the keypad on top of the upper
       right-hand corner of the <b>x3270</b> window, just under the keypad
       button on the menu bar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in x3270 3.3.1alpha9, 24. July 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>DBCS character set names are displayed only when DBCS support is
       built into x3270.</li>
      <li>Removed the concept of 'per-host' resources.  Use profiles for
       this.</li>
      <li>Fixed idle commands.  They were pretty much hopeless in 3.3.1alpha8
       and 3.2.20.</li>
      <li>Fixed a Unicode conversion crash.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in processing the Modify Field order, which would cause
       the character set attribute for the field to be accidentally reset to
       the default.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>User-specified lists (character sets, hosts, fonts, color schemes)
       can now be organized into sub-lists.  The name <b>Bob>Fred>Tony</b>
       specifies that there is a sub-list called <b>Bob</b>, which contains a
       sub-list <b>Fred</b>, which contains the item <b>Tony</b>.</li>
       <li>The TELNET START-TLS option is now supported.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
