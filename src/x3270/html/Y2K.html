<h1>x3270 Year 2000 Compliance Statement
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>
The subset of the 3270 Data Stream protocol that x3270 3.2 implements does
not include any date fields.
<P>x3270 3.2 itself does not use dates or absolute times, except for adding
timestamps to optional logs.
<P>x3270 3.2 does manipulate small relative time intervals, for the purpose
of timing out connection requests and other internal operations. These
depend on system facilities which may have inherent overflow problems (such
as a Unix timestamp overflowing at 2^32 seconds past 1/1/1970), but none
are Y2K-sensitive.
<P>Beyond that, x3270 3.2 may fall victim to Y2K problems in the local OS,
C library, X windows libraries, or X server.
