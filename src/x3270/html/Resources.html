<H1>x3270 Resources</H1>

Here is a complete list of the customizable X11 resources used by x3270, their
meanings, default values, command-line switches and menu options that change
them.
<P>
Note that any resource can be set on the command line with the -xrm switch.
<PRE>
x3270.activeIcon	Default false		Switch -activeicon
    This one is a lot of fun.  When set to true, x3270's icon becomes a live
    miniature of the screen display.  There are some limitations, spelled out
    in the man page.

x3270.allowResize	Default true
    When true, the x3270 window can be resized by the mouse (actually, by the
    window manager).  When false, the window can only be resized from menu
    options.  The purpose of disabling mouse resizing is to allow a window
    bigger than will fit on the screen, which some window managers (e.g., mwm)
    will not allow if permitted to resize it.

x3270.altCursor		Default false		Switch -set altCursor
			Option Underline Cursor	       -clear altCursor
			       Block Cursor
    When set to true, this causes x3270 to use with the alternate (underscore)
    cursor.

x3270.aplFont		Default	3270-apl
    The font used when in apl mode (when the -apl switch is used).  It is
    assumed that this is a 3270 font (one with the same ordering as 3270 and
    3270-12), but with special APL characters in place of accented (ISO
    Latin-1) characters.

x3270.background	Default white		Switches: -bg, -rv
    The background color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome X displays, the
    emulator window.

x3270.bellVolume	Default 0
    Controls the volume used when ringing the terminal bell.  The value
    ranges from -100 (silent) through 0 (normal) to +100 (loud).  Not all
    X servers can vary the bell volume, other than turning it on and off.
    This resource can be overridden by the x3270.visualBell resource, which
    if set to true, will replace the bell with a flash of the screen.

x3270.boldColor		Default green
    To emulate the old 'pseudo-color' mode, set this resource to 'cyan'.
    It will be used in 3278 mode to display intensified text.

x3270.blankFill		Default false		Option Blank Fill
			Switch -set blankFill
			       -clear blankFill
    When set to true, in 3270 mode x3270 will automatically convert trailing
    blanks in a field to nulls in order to insert a character, and will
    automatically convert leading nulls to blanks so that input data is not
    squeezed to the left.  This eliminates some of the quirkier behavior of
    real 3270 terminals.

x3270.bsdTm		Default false
    Defines x3270's response to the TELNET DO TIMING MARK option.  When set
    to false (the default), x3270 will respond to DO TIMING MARK with WONT
    TIMING MARK, which is consistent with most modern TELNET clients.  When
    set to true, x3270 will respond with WILL TIMING MARK, which is consistent
    with the old BSD 'telnet' program and with previous versions of x3270.
    In either case, x3270 will not respond to a DONT TIMING MARK option.

x3270.charset		Default bracket		Switch -charset
    This defines the host EBCDIC character set, that is, what glyph (image) is
    displayed for each EBCDIC code sent by the host.

x3270.charsetList	Default U.S. International: us-intl
				Bracket: bracket
				German: german
				Finnish: finnish
				United Kingdom: uk
				Norwegian: norwegian
				French: french
				Hebrew: hebrew
    Defines the "Character Set" pull-right menu.  Can contain '>' characters
    to define a menu hierarchy.

x3270.color8		Default False
    If set to True, x3270 will respond to a Query(Color) with a list of 8
    supported colors.  If set to False (the default), it will send a list
    of 16 colors.  The 8-color setting is required for some hosts which
    abort a session if 16 colors are reported.

x3270.colorBackground	Default black
    The background color for the emulator window.  This resource is used only
    on color X displays when the x3270.model specifies 3278 mode.  On
    monochrome X displays, the background color is white, unless -rv (reverse
    video) is selected on the command line; in 3279 mode, the screen background
    is determined by the x3270.colorScheme resource.

x3270.colorScheme	Default default
			Options Default 3279: default
				Bright: bright
				Reverse: reverse
				Green Screen: greenScreen
    Defines the colors used to paint the emulator window in 3279 (full-color)
    mode.  This resource is used only when the "x3270.model" specifies a 3279
    display.  For each color scheme <i>x</i>, an additional resources by the name of
    colorScheme.<i>x</i> must be defined.

x3270.colorScheme.default
x3270.colorScheme.reverse
x3270.colorScheme.bright
x3270.colorScheme.cpe
x3270.colorScheme.greenScreen
    Individual color scheme definitions.  Each resource is a list of 23 items:
     0  X color to use for IBM "neutral/black" (also used as ANSI color 0)
     1	X color to use for IBM "blue" (also used for ANSI color 4)
     2	X color to use for IBM "red" (also used for ANSI color 1)
     3	X color to use for IBM "pink" (also used for ANSI color 5)
     4	X color to use for IBM "green" (also used for ANSI color 2)
     5	X color to use for IBM "turquoise"
     6	X color to use for IBM "yellow" (also used for ANSI color 3)
     7	X color to use for IBM "neutral/white"
     8	X color to use for IBM "black"
     9	X color to use for IBM "deep blue"
     10	X color to use for IBM "orange"
     11	X color to use for IBM "purple"
     12	X color to use for IBM "pale green"
     13	X color to use for IBM "pale turquoise" (also used for ANSI color 6)
     14	X color to use for IBM "grey"
     15	X color to use for IBM "white" (also used for ANSI color 7)
     16 X color to use if one of 0..15 cannot be allocated (white or black)
     17 X color to use as the default screen background
     18 X color to use as the select background
     19 IBM color index (0..15) to use for unprotected, unhighlighted fields
     20 IBM color index (0..15) to use for unprotected, highlighted fields
     21 IBM color index (0..15) to use for protected, unhighlighted fields
     22 IBM color index (0..15) to use for protected, highlighted fields

x3270.commandTimeout
    (tcl3270 only) Defines the number of seconds to wait for a command to
    complete before failing it with a timeout error.

x3270.composeMap	Default latin1
    Gives the name of the map used to define the pairs of characters that
    form composite characters with the Compose key.

x3270.composeMap.latin1
x3270.composeMap.apl
    For each compose map <i>x</i>, an additional resource by the name of
    composeMap.<i>x</i> must be defined.  Each line in the resource is of the form
    "keysym1 + keysym2 = keysym3", meaning "when the Compose key is pressed,
    followed by keysym1 and keysym2 (in either order), interpret it as
    keysym3."  The definitions are case-sensitive.

x3270.connectFileName	Default ~/.x3270connect
    Gives the name of the file to consult and store the recently-connected
    host list in.  If given the value "none", no file will be read or
    written.  Note that by default, this file is shared among all instances
    of x3270 that run under the same username.

x3270.crosshair		Default false		Switch -set crosshair
						       -clear crosshair
    When set to true, causes x3270 to display a crosshair over the cursor:
    lines extending with height and width of the screen.

x3270.cursorBlink	Default false		Switch -set cursorBlink
						       -clear cursorBlink
    When set to true, this causes x3270 to use a blinking cursor.

x3270.cursorColor	Default red
    On color X displays, this is the color of the text cursor.  This resource
    is used only if the x3270.useCursorColor resource is set to true.

x3270.cursorPos		Default true		Switch -set cursorPos
			Option Track Cursor	       -clear cursorPos
    When set to true, causes x3270 to display the cursor location on the
    status line.

x3270.dbcsCgcsgid
    Overrides the compiled-in value of the CGCSGID for the current host
    character set.  The value is an integer, which can be preceded with '0x'
    to be in hexadecimal.  The upper 16 bits are the GCSGID (character
    set) and the lower 16 bits are the CPGID (code page).  This value
    applies only to the double-byte (DBCS) character set.  Use
    x3270.sbcsCgcsgid for the single-byte (SBCS) character set.

x3270.debugTracing	Default true
    If set to true, options are available on the File menu to trace the 3270
    data stream and X events.  If set to false, these options are not
    displayed.

x3270.dftBufferSize	Default 4096
    Specifies the default buffer size for DFT IND$FILE file transfers.  This
    value can be overridden in the File Transfer dialog and by a parameter to
    the Transfer action.

x3270.disconnectClear	Default false
    If set to true, x3270 will clear the screen when a host disconnects.

x3270.doConfirms	Default true
    When set to true, x3270 will display a pop-up to report successful
    completion of certain operations, such as screen printing.  When
    set to false, these pop-ups are not displayed.

x3270.dsTrace		Default false		 Switch -trace 
			Option Trace Data Stream        -set dsTrace
							-clear Trace
    When true, x3270 writes a hexadecimal representation of all network
    traffic, and its interpretation, into a file, which defaults to
    /tmp/x3trc.&#60;pid>.  It also pops up a window to watch the file as it
    is created, with the pathname of the file as the window title.  The
    command run in the window is defined by the traceCommand resource.  The
    directory prefix is defined by the traceDir resource.  If the traceFile
    resource is defined, it explicitly defines the file name and traceDir
    is ignored.

x3270.emulatorFont	Default 3270 (*)	Switch -efont
			Options 3270 Font (14 point): 3270
				8-point Font: 3270gt8
				12-point Font: 3270-12
				16-point Font: 3270gt16
				20-point Font: 3270-20
				24-point Font: 3270gt24
				32-point Font: 3270gt32
				Debug Font: 3270d
			        Other Font...
    The font used for the emulator window.  By default it is 3270, a 14-pixel
    clone of a real 3278 display font.  A nice substitution is 3270-12, which
    is a little more compact.  Actually, x3270 can use any X font, so long as
    it uses constant spacing.  However, only 3270 and 3270-12 allow displaying
    all special symbols on the status line.

    (*) Actually, the default for emulatorFont is the value of the first font
    in the x3270.emulatorFontList.<i>displayCharset</i> resource, below.

x3270.emulatorFontList.<i>displayCharset</i>	Default: 3270 Font (14 point): #resize 3270
				 8-point Font: #resize 3270gt8
				 12-point Font: #resize 3270-12
				 16-point Font: #resize 3270gt16
				 20-point Font: #resize 3270-20
				 24-point Font: #resize 3270gt24
				 32-point Font: #resize 3270gt32
				 Debug Font: #noauto 3270d
    A list of known fonts for a given <i>displayCharset</i>.  Each line describes
    a font.  The list serves two purposes: it is presented as the <b>Font</b> menu
    when the <i>displayCharset</i> is selected, and it is searched when that
    <i>displayCharset</i> is selected for use.

    On each line, if there is text separated by a ":", that text appears as the
    menu label.  Otherwise, the font name is displayed.  If the keyword
    <b>#noauto</b> appears before the font name, the font will not be a
    candidate for automatic selection when the <i>displayCharset</i> is selected.
    If the keyword <b>#resize</b> appears before the font name, the font will
    be used to change the screen size in response to Window Manager requests.
    Finally, a font name may be preceded by a "!" to override character set
    checking, in case the font's properties have been improperly defined.

    Each emulatorFontList is implicitly followed by two entries:
	*-r-*-c-*-<i>displayCharset</i>
	*-r-*-m-*-<i>displayCharset</i>
    (Actually, each of those two entries will be expanded for each of the
    components in the <i>displayCharset</i>).  This will find any
    constant-spaced fonts implementing that display character set.

    An emulatorFontList resource can contain '>' characters to indicate a menu
    hierarchy.  For example, an definition like this:
        GoodFonts>8-point Font: 3278gt8
	GoodFonts>12-point Font: 3270-12
	BadFonts>16-point Font: 3270gt16
	BadFonts>24-point Font: 3270gt24
    will result in a two-level menu hierarchy.  The first level will have two
    items, GoodFonts and BadFonts.  Each will have a pull-right with two
    entries.

x3270.eof		Default ^D
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.erase		Default ^?
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special characters used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    functions as the "stty" parameters of the same name.

    When connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII character that is sent to
    the host in response to the Erase action.

x3270.eventTrace	Default false		 Switch -set eventTrace
			Option Trace X Events           -clear eventTrace
    When true, x3270 traces information about the X events that it processes
    into a file, which defaults to /tmp/x3trc.&#60;pid>.  It also pops up a
    window to watch the file as it is created, with the pathname of the file
    as the window title.  The command run in the window is defined by the
    traceCommand resource.  The directory prefix is defined by the traceDir
    resource.   If the traceFile resource is defined, it explicitly defines
    the file name and traceDir is ignored.

x3270.extended		Default false		Switch -extended
    *** DEPRECATED RESOURCE -- REPLACED BY NEW x3270.model SYNTAX ***
    If set to true, enables support of the 3270 Extended Data Stream, which
    allows extended highlighting, structured fields, and query reply.  The
    actual difference is that a "-E" is appended to the default terminal
    name which is passed to the host through TELNET negotiations, indicating
    support for the feature.  If the x3270.m3279 resource is true,
    x3270.extended is automatically assumed to be true as well.

x3270.fixedSize
    If set to a value <i>width</i>x<i>height</i>, specifies a fixed size
    for the x3270 display.  The 3270 emulator will float in the center of the
    window, if need be.

x3270.foreground	Default black		Switches: -fg, -rv
    The foreground color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome X displays, the
    emulator display.

x3270.highlightBold	Default False
    If true, then highlighted fields are displayed in bold.  If false, then
    highlighted fields are displayed in the usual font.

x3270.hostsFile		Default /usr/lib/X11/x3270/ibm_hosts
    The name of a file listing the host names that appear on the "Connect"
    pull-down menu.  The format of the file is explained on the ibm_hosts man
    page.

x3270.iconFont		Default nil2
    The font used to paint the text inside the active icon.  "nil2" is a
    one-by-two pixel font that produces a "greeked" picture of the screen
    image.

x3270.iconLabelFont 	Default 8x13
    When activeIcon and labelIcon are true, this is the name of the font used
    to paint the icon label.

x3270.icrnl		Default true
    Used in ANSI mode; similar to the "stty" parameter of the same name.
    Controls whether input carriage returns are mapped to newlines.

x3270.idleCommand
x3270.idleCommandEnabled	Default false
x3270.idleTimeout	Default ~7m
    When idleCommand is defined, it specifies a command to execute after a
    period of keyboard inactivity (no AID keys pressed).  idleCommand can be
    an arbitrary sequence of x3270 actions, but it should include an action
    which generates an AID (PF(), PA(), Clear() or Enter()).
    idleCommandEnabled must be set to "true" in order for the idleCommand to
    take effect.  idleTimeout specifies the inactivity interval.  If it begins
    with a tilde ("~"), the time will be randomly varied +/-10% from the value
    specified.  If the values ends in 'h', it specifies hours; if it ends in
    'm' is specifies minutes; if it ends in 's' or does not have an
    alphanumeric suffix, it specifies seconds.

x3270.inlcr		Default false
    Used in ANSI mode; similar to the "stty" parameter of the same name.
    Controls whether input newlines are mapped to carriage returns.

x3270.inputColor	Default orange
    To emulate the old 'pseudo-color' mode, set this resource to 'orange'.
    It will be used in 3278 mode to display light-pen selectable text.
    If the resource x3270.modifiedSel is set to true, modified fields are also
    displayed in this color.

x3270.inputMethod	No Default		Switch -im
    Specifies the name of the input method to use for multi-byte input.  The
    default is specified by the XMODIFIERS environment variable, if set, or is
    constructed by Xlib based on the current locale.

    Supported only when x3270 is compiled with DBCS support.

x3270.intr		Default ^C
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.invertKeypadShift	Default false
    When set to true, this causes the PF1-PF12 and PF13-PF24 keys on the
    pop-up keypad to be swapped.  Normally, the low-numbered keys appear;
    when Shift, Alt, Ctrl or Meta is pressed, the high-numbered keys appear.
    With this resource set to true, that is reversed.

x3270.keymap		No Default		Switch -keymap
    The name of the keyboard map to use.  If no keymap resource is specified,
    the environment variables KEYMAP and KEYBD are checked (in that order) for
    the keymap name.

    For each keymap <i>x</i>, an additional resource by the name x3270.keymap.<i>x</i>
    must be defined, which gives the actual key mappings.  These are in X
    translation table format.

    The name may be followed by any number of comma-separated modifier names,
    e.g., if the keymap name "sun-k4,ow", means keymap "sun-k4" and modifier
    "ow".

    For each keymap modifier <i>x</i>, an additional resource by the name
    x3270.keymap.<i>x</i> must be defined, which gives the actual key mappings.
    These are also in X translation table format.

x3270.keymap.sun-k5
x3270.keymap.sun-k4
x3270.keymap.sun-k3
x3270.keymap.ncd
x3270.keymap.hp-k1
x3270.keymap.hp-pc
    These are predefined keymaps.

x3270.keymap.ow
x3270.keymap.apl
x3270.keymap.t
x3270.keymap.finnish7
x3270.keymap.norwegian7
    These are predefined keymap modifiers:
    - "ow" makes the mouse work more like OpenWindows defaults
    - "apl" is automatically applied when in apl mode (the -apl switch is used)
    - "t" is useful for keymap debugging; it maps Meta-z to an action that
	displays the current keymap
    - "finnish7" and "norwegian7" are for compatibility with certain 7-bit
	international keyboards

x3270.keypad		Default right
    This controls the position of the pop-up keypad.  It can have one of
    five values: left, meaning a pop-up window positioned to the left of the
    main x3270 window; right, meaning a pop-up window positioned to the right
    of the main x3270 window; bottom, meaning a pop-up window positioned below
    the main x3270 window; integral, making the keypad an extension of the
    bottom of the main window itself, and insideRight, placing the keypad
    over the upper-right corner of the emulator window, just below the keypad
    button on the menu bar.

x3270.keypad.keyHeight	Default 24
    The height in pixels of all of the buttons on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.keyWidth	Default 48
    The width in pixels of the lower tier of buttons on a horizontal keypad.

x3270.keypad.largeKeyWidth	Default 56
    The width in pixels of the lower tier of buttons on a vertical keypad.

x3270.keypad.paWidth	Default 36
    The width in pixels of PA and cursor keys on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.pfWidth	Default 32
    The width in pixels of PF keys on the keypad.

x3270.keypadBackground	Default grey70
    On color X displays, this is the color of the empty area behind the buttons
    on the main window and keypad window.  On monochrome X displays, these
    areas are filled with a 50% grey bitmap.

x3270.keypadOn		Default false
    If set to true, the keypad will automatically appear when x3270 is started.

x3270.kill		Default ^U
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special characters used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    functions as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

    When connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII characters that is sent to
    the host in response to the DeleteField action.

x3270.labelIcon		Default false
    When activeIcon is true, MIT's twm window manager will not put a label on
    x3270's icon.  Setting labelIcon to true causes x3270 to supply its own
    label for the icon.

x3270.lineWrap		Default true		Switch -set lineWrap
			Option Wraparound	       -clear lineWrap
    When set to true, in ANSI mode x3270 will automatically insert a 
    Newline then output reaches the end of a line.  When false, output can
    pile up at the end of each line.

x3270.lnext		Default ^V
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.lockedCursor	Default X_cursor
    The name of the mouse cursor displayed with x3270 is not connected to a
    host.

x3270.m3279		Default false		Switch -color
    *** DEPRECATED RESOURCE -- REPLACED BY NEW x3270.model SYNTAX ***
    If true and running on a color X display, x3270 runs in full 3279 color
    mode.  If false, x3270 runs in 3278 (green screen) mode.

x3270.macros
x3270.macros.host1
x3270.macros.host2
    Defines a set of macros assigned to a pull-down menu that appears when
    connected to a host.  The syntax is similar to a keymap (an X11 translation
    table), except that rather than a keysym name, the left-hand side is a
    name that will appear on the menu.  Any single action can be specified
    on the right-hand side.

    Definitions of the form "x3270.macros.&#60;xxx>" define the macros menu when
    connected to host &#60;xxx>, which override the "x3270.macros" definitions.

x3270.marginedPaste	Default false		Switch -set marginedPaste
			Option Paste With Left Margin  -clear marginedPaste
    When set to true, x3270 will use the current cursor position as a left
    margin for pasted data: no pasted data will be input into an area to the
    left of the current cursor positon.

x3270.menuBar		Default true
    If set to false, the menu bar will not be displayed at the top of the
    x3270 main window.  The three pull-down menus are still available, however,
    by pressing Ctrl and each of the mouse buttons.

x3270.model		Default 3278-4-E (mono)	Switch -model
				3279-4-E (color)
			Options Model 2
			        Model 3
			        Model 4
			        Model 5
    The terminal model that x3270 is emulating.  The model is in three parts,
    separated by dashes; each part is optional.
	3278 or 3279
	    "3278" specifies a monochrome 3270 display.  If used on a color
	     X display, it will cause all fields to be drawn in green.
	     3278 is the default for monochrome X displays.
	    "3279" specifies a color 3270 display.  This is the default for
	     color X displays.
	2, 3, 4 or 5
	    The model number, which determines the size of the screen.  The
	     default is 4.
	E
	    An optional suffix which specifies support for the 3270 Extended
	     Data Stream (color, extended attributes, query reply).  3279
	     implies E.

x3270.modifiedSel       Default false
    When set to true, modified fields are displayed in a different color than
    other modifiable fields.  In 3278 mode, this color is the "input" (light
    pen selectable) color, defined by the x3270.inputColor resource.  In 3279
    mode, this is the color whose index is defined by the
    x3270.modifiedSelColor resource.  When x3270.modifiedSel is set to false,
    modified fields are displayed in the same colors as unmodified fields.

x3270.modifiedSelColor	Default 10
    In 3279 mode, when the x3270.modifiedSel resource is set to true, this
    is the index of the color used to display modified fields.  The value is
    not an X color name or specification; rather it is a 3279 color index,
    as documented under the x3270.colorScheme resource.  The default value
    is 10, which corresponds to "orange".

x3270.mono		Default false		Switch -mono
    If set to true, x3270 will operate as if it were running on a monochrome X
    display.

x3270.monoCase		Default false		Switch -set monoCase
			Option Monocase		       -clear monoCase
    When true, causes x3270 to run in uppercase-only mode.

x3270.noOther		Default false
    If set to true, the "Other" options are disabled for selecting fonts
    and connecting to hosts, limiting users to the options provided on
    the menus.

x3270.numericLock	Default false
    When true, causes x3270 to lock the keyboard when non-numeric data is
    entered into fields with the Numeric attribute.

x3270.normalColor	Default green
    On color X displays in 3278 mode, this is the color of normal-intensity
    text.  On monochrome X displays, normal text uses the foreground color.

x3270.onlcr		Default true
    Used in ANSI line mode; similar to the "stty" parameter of the same name.
    Controls whether output newlines are mapped to CR/LF sequences.

x3270.oerrLock		Default true
    If set to true, operator errors (typing into protected fields, insert
    overflow, etc.) will cause the keyboard to lock with an error message
    on the status line.  If set to false, the terminal bell will ring,
    without any keyboard lock or message.

x3270.once		Default false		Switch -once
    When true, x3270 will exit as soon as a host disconnects.

x3270.oversize					Switch -oversize
    Sets the screen dimensions to be larger than the default for the
    chosen model.  Its value is a string in the format "COLSxROWS".  It is
    used only if the value of "x3270.model" includes a "-E" (extended
    data stream) suffix, and if the specified dimensions are larger than
    the model number defaults.  Also, only hosts that support the Query Reply
    structured field will function properly with x3270 in this mode.

x3270.port		Default telnet		Switch -port
    The name of the default TCP port for x3270 to connect to.  This can be
    either a symbolic name from /etc/services, or an integer.

x3270.proxy					Switch -proxy
    Defines a proxy server that x3270 will use to connect to hosts.
    The value is of the form "type:server[:port]", where the value of "type"
    is defined on the manual page.

x3270.preeditType	Default OverTheSpot+1	Switch -pt
    The preedit type for the multi-byte input method.  Valid values are
    "OverTheSpot", "OffTheSpot", "Root" and "OnTheSpot".  The value for
    "OverTheSpot" can include an optional suffix, a signed number indicating
    the vertical distance in rows of the preedit window from the cursor
    position, e.g.  "OverTheSpot+1" or "OverTheSpot-2".

    Supported  only when x3270 is compiled with DBCS support.

x3270.printerLu					Switch -printerlu
    If a value is set, x3270 will automatically start a pr3287 printer session
    when a host is connected to.  If the value is ".", the pr3287 session will
    be associated with the interactive terminal session (this requires that
    the host support TN3270E).  Otherwise, the value is assumed to be the LU
    name to associate with the printer session.

x3270.printer.assocCommandLine
			Default pr3287 -assoc %L% -command %C% %R% %H%
    The shell command to use to start a printer session, associated with the
    current TN3270E session LU.  Within the string, the following substitutions
    are made:
	%L% is replaced with the current session's LU
	%C% is replaced with the value of the x3270.printer.command resource
	%H% is replaced with the current host name
	%R% is replaced with an option to pass the current character set
	 definition (-charset @/tmp/cs<pid>)

x3270.printer.command	Default lpr
    The name of the command supplied to the "-command" option of the pr3287
    program to print each job.  This is the text which is substituted for
    "%C" in the x3270.printer.assocCommandLine and x3270.printer.luCommandLine
    resources.

x3270.printer.luCommandLine
			Default pr3287 -command %C% %R% %L%@%H%
    The shell command to use to start a printer session, associated with a
    specific LU.  Within the string, the following substitutions are made:
	%L% is replaced with the LU value entered into the dialog box
	%C% is replaced with the value of the x3270.printer.command resource
	%H% is replaced with the current host name
	%R% is replaced with an option to pass the current character set
	 definition (-charset @/tmp/cs<pid>)

x3270.printTextCommand	Default lpr
    The shell command used by the PrintText action.  An ASCII image of the
    3270 display becomes the standard input to this command.  If the first
    character of the command is '@', the usual pop-up windows before and after
    the text is printed will not appear.

x3270.printWindowCommand	Default xwd -id %d | xpr | lpr
    The shell command used by the PrintWindow action.  The X window identifier
    of the main x3270 window is substituted for any "%d" in the command.  If
    the first character of the command is '@', the usual pop-up windows before
    and after the window is printed will not appear.

x3270.quit		Default ^\\
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.rectangleSelect	Default false		Switch -set rectangleSelect
			Option Select by Rectangles    -clear rectangleSelect
    When set to true, x3270 will always select rectangular areas of the
    screen.  When false, x3270 will select rectangular areas in 3270 mode, but
    in ANSI mode it will select continuous areas of the screen like xterm.

x3270.rprnt		Default ^R
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.saveLines		Default 64		Switch -sl
    The number of display lines to save for the scroll bar.

x3270.sbcsCgcsgid
    Overrides the compiled-in value of the CGCSGID for the current host
    character set.  The value is an integer, which can be preceded with '0x'
    to be in hexadecimal.  The upper 16 bits are the GCSGID (character
    set) and the lower 16 bits are the CPGID (code page).  This value
    applies only to the single-byte (SBCS) character set.  Use
    x3270.dbcsCgcsgid for the double-byte (DBCS) character set.

x3270.schemeList	Default Default 3279: default
				Bright: bright
				Reverse: reverse
				Green Screen: greenScreen
    Lists the options on the Color Scheme menu.  Can contain '>' characters to
    indicate a menu hierarchy.

x3270.screenTrace	Default false		Switch -set screenTrace
			Option Save Screen(s) in File  -clear screenTrace
    When true, x3270 will save an ASCII version of the screen image in
    a file, which defaults to /tmp/x3scr.&#60;pid>, every time it is redrawn.
    The directory prefix is defined by the traceDir resource.   If the
    screenTraceFile resource is defined, it explicitly defines the file name
    and traceDir is ignored.

x3270.screenTraceFile	No default
    If defined, gives the name of the file that screen traces will be
    written to.

x3270.scripted		Default false		Switch -scripted
    When true, x3270 will read commands from standard input.  The rules for
    these commands are documented in x3270script(1).

x3270.scrollBar		Default false		Switches -sb, +sb
			Option Scrollbar		 -set scrollBar
							 -clear scrollBar
    When true, x3270 will display a scroll bar to the right of the emulator
    window.

x3270.secure		Default false
    When true, x3270 will prevent users from executing arbitrary commands
    from within the program.  In particular, the "Execute an Action" menu
    option is disabled, as are the pop-ups which allow editing the commands
    for "Print Screen Text" and "Print Window Bitmap", and the
    x3270.disconnectClear resource is set to True.  See the x3270.noOther
    resource for additional security options.

x3270.selectBackground	Default dimGrey
    On color X displays, this is the background color used for selected text
    (text highlighted with the mouse for cut and paste).  On monochrome
    X displays, selected text is in reverse video.

x3270.showTiming	Default false		Switch -set showTiming
			Option Show Timing	       -clear showTiming
    When true, x3270 will display on the status line the time that the host
    takes to unlock the keyboard after an AID is sent.

x3270*suppress		No default
    When set to true, suppresses a given menu item.  For example, setting
    x3270executeActionOption.label to true will remove the Execute an
    Action option on the File menu.  The names of the menu items generally
    end in 'Option' and have label resources in X3270.xad.

x3270.suppressActions	No default
    A list of whitespace-separated action names, with or without parentheses,
    which are to be ignored.  The actions will be completely inaccessible,
    whether by keymaps, scripts, macros or the Execute an Action menu option.
    This resource is intended to be used as a security precaution for users
    who can define their own keymaps, but who do not have access to resource
    definitions or command-line options.

x3270.termName		Default IBM-327x-n	Switch -tn
    An alternate name to be sent in response to the host's "DO OPTION
    TERMINAL-NAME" request.  The default is "IBM-" followed bu the value of
    the "x2370.model" resource.

x3270.traceDir		Default /tmp
    Defines the directory that data stream traces and screen images are saved
    in.

x3270.traceFile		No default		Switch -tracefile
    If defined, gives the name of the file that data stream and event traces
    will be written to.  If given the value 'stdout', then the traces will
    be written to standard output.  If given the value 'none', then the
    traces will be piped directory to the monitor window, and no file will
    be created.

x3270.traceFileSize	No default		Switch -tracefilesize
    If defined, gives a limit on the size of the file that data stream and
    event traces will be written to.  If not defined, or defined as '0', there
    will be no limit on the size of the file.  The value is a number, followed
    by an optional suffix.  If the suffix is 'K' (e.g., '128K'), the value will
    be multiplied by 1024.  If the suffix is 'M', the value will be multiplied
    by (1024*1024).  The size limit enforced at operation boundaries, not per
    byte, so the actual file may grow slightly larger.  When the file size
    exceeds the limit, the second half of the file will be written over the
    first, so that in steady state, the file size will vary between half the
    traceFileSize and the entire traceFileSize.

x3270.traceMonitor	Default true
    When true, x3270 will create an xterm to monitor data stream and event
    traces.  When false, no monitor window will be created (and the value of
    'none' for x3270.traceFile will be invalid).

x3270.typeahead		Default true
    When true, x3270 will store keystrokes in a buffer when the keyboard is
    locked.  When false, these keystrokes will be dropped.

x3270.unlockDelay	Default true
    When true, x3270 will delay actually unlocking the keyboard for 350ms
    after the host permits it.  This is a hack to allow easier scripting of
    hosts that permaturely unlock the keyboard.  Setting unlockDelay to false
    disables this delay, except for when executing a macro.

x3270.unlockDelayMs	Default 350
    Overrides the default value for the unlock delay (the delay between the
    host unlocking the keyboard and x3270 actually performing the unlock).
    The value is in milliseconds; use 0 to turn off the delay completely,
    including for macros.

x3270.useCursorColor	Default false
    If set to false, the cursor is drawn using the same color as the text
    behind it.  If set to true, on color X displays the cursor is drawn with
    the color specified by the x3270.cursorColor resource.

x3270.visualBell	Default false
    When true, x3270 will flash the screen in response to an ALARM WCC or
    BELL character, rather than ringing the X display's bell.

x3270.visualSelect	Default false
    This resource controls how x3270 displays light pen selectable fields
    that do not have a color explicitly set by the host.  When set to true,
    x3270 these fields using the color defined by x3270.visualSelectColor
    (default 6).  When set to false, x3270 will display these fields based on
    their highlighting attribute.  The attribute is used only in 3279 mode.

x3270.visualSelectColor	Default 6
    The 3270 color index of the color to use when displaying light pen
    selectable fields.  This resource is used only if x3270.visualSelect is
    set to true.  The default is 6 (yellow).

x3270.waitCursor	Default watch
    The name of the mouse cursor displayed when x3270 is connected to a host,
    but is unable to process keyboard input.  Cursor names are in the file
    &#60;X11/cursorfont.h>.

x3270.werase		Default ^W
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

    When connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII character that is sent to
    the host in response to the DeleteWord action.

x3270*keyPad*large*font	Default fixed
    The font used to paint the "large" labels on the keys in the keypad, i.e.,
    the PA and PF keys.

x3270*keyPad*small*font	Default -*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
    The font used to paint the "small" labels on the keys in the keypad, e.g.,
    the "Mono Case" key.

x3270*value*font	Default fixed
    The is the name of the font used for the input fields in data entry
    pop-ups.

x3270*dataLabel.font	Default -*-terminal-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
    The font used to display values in the "About x3270" pop-up.

x3270*font:		Default -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
    The font used for everything else.

x3270.baselevelTranslations
    The default translation table for the main window and keypad.  This may
    be modified with great care, however, it makes more sense to use keymaps
    to accomplish customizations.
