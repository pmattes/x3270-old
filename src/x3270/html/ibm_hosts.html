ibm_hosts - host database for <B>x3270</B>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
/usr/lib/X11/x3270/ibm_hosts
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
The <B>ibm_hosts</B>
file contains information regarding IBM hosts on the network.
An <I>IBM host</I>
is a host which can communicate with a 3270 terminal emulator such as
<B>x3270</B> or <B>tn3270</B>.
Each line defines a name in the following format
(optional fields are shown in brackets):
<PRE>
    name type hostname[/port] [actions]
</PRE>
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or TAB characters.
A line beginning with `#' is taken as a comment (note that `#' anywhere
else on a line does <I>not</I> indicate a comment).
<P>
The <I>name</I> field is a mnemonic used to identify the host.
<P>
The <I>type</I> field is a keyword that indicates the type of entry.
The value <B>primary</B> means that the <I>name</I>
will be included in host-selection menus that may be displayed by a
3270 emulator.
The value <B>alias</B> means that the <I>name</I>
will not be included in menus, but will still be accepted as valid input
when a host name is required.
<P>
The <I>hostname</I>
field is the Internet hostname or dot-notation Internet address of the host.
<P>
The <I>hostname</I> can also optionally include a non-default
<I>port</I> number, appended to the <I>hostname</I>
with a slash ``/'' character,
<I>e.g.</I>, <B>bluehost/9700</B>.
<P>
The optional <I>actions</I> field
specifies actions to be taken once the connection is made and a data-entry
field is defined.
If the text looks like an action, <I>e</I>.<I>g</I>., <B>PF(1)</B>,
it is unmodified; otherwise it is taken as the parameter to the
<B>String()</B> action.
The <I>actions</I>
are not intended for entering usernames and passwords; rather they provide an
automated way of specifying a front-end menu option.
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>
Given the following <B>ibm_hosts</B> file:
<PRE>
    mvs  primary  mvs-host
    tso  alias    mvs-host
    mvs2 primary  mvs-host/4012
    vm   primary  vtam          Tab() String(3) Enter()
</PRE>
An 3270 emulator will display four names (<B>mvs</B>, <B>mvs2</B>,
<B>afhost</B> and <B>vm</B>) on its hosts menu.
The names <B>mvs</B> and <B>tso</B> will cause connections to the host
<B>mvs-host</B>.
The name <B>mvs2</B> will also cause a connection to
<B>mvs-host</B>,
but to port 4012 rather than the emulator's default port (usually 23).
The name <B>vm</B> will cause the 3270 emulator to connect to the host
<B>vtam</B> (presumably some sort of host-selection front-end),
enter the string ``3'' on the second data-entry field on the screen, and
send the ENTER AID sequence.
