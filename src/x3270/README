Please read Build before going ahead and building the program. Also, if you
have a problem, scan through FAQ; there are lots of interesting answers
there. 

Updates to x3270 are available on ftp.x.org and several X11R6 mirror sites,
usually in the /contrib/applications/x3270 directory. Fixes are often
distributed as patch files (you will need gnu patch to apply them) under the
name fix.nn, e.g., the next fix to version 3.0.3 will be x3270-3.0.3.fix08. 

Feel free to send comments, criticism, suggestions, complaints, etc., to Paul
Mattes, x3270@cnt.com. Requests will be addressed as time and resources
permit. 

There is also an x3270 mailing list, which receives news about new releases.
