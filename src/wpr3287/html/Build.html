<h1> wpr3287 Build Instructions</h1>
<i>wpr3287</i> is built on Windows using the MinGW tools under Cygwin.
For more information about MinGW, visit the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">
MinGW webpage</a>.
For more information about Cygwin, visit the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">
Cygwin webpage</a>.
<p>
  To build <i>wpr3287</i>, start a Cygwin shell, <b>cd</b> to the directory where
  the source code resides, and type:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make</pre>
</p>
<p>
  This process will probably fail (sorry) because the Makefile assumes that you
  have installed a MinGW-compatible version of the OpenSSL library.  This is
  not a commonly-available package but can be easily built from source.
  Visit the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL webpage</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
  To build without SSL support, there are three lines to comment out in the
  <b>Makefile</b> before running <b>make</b>.
</p>
  <i>wpr3287</i> was developed primarily on 32-bit Windows XP, but should be
  buildable on Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000.  It has not been built
  or tested on 64-bit Windows or on Windows Vista.
