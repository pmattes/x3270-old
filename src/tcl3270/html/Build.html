<H1>tcl3270 Build and Install Instructions</H1>

To build tcl3270, type:
<PRE>
    make
</PRE>
To install tcl3270 in the default install directory (/usr/local), type:
<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>
To install in a different directory, add an INSTALLDIR= clause to the
make command, e.g.:
<PRE>
    make install INSTALLDIR=/tools
</PRE>
Note that tcl3270 uses tcl 8.2, and assumes that tcl has been installed in
/usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib.  If you have a different version of tcl,
or it is installed in different directories, you may need to edit the Makefile
before building tcl3270.
<P>
tcl3270 has <B>not</B> been tested with earlier versions of tcl.
