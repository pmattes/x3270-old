<h1>
tcl3270 Version 3.2 -- New Features and Bug Fixes</h1>

<h2>Changes in tcl3270 3.2.20, 14. February 2003</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Corrected the <b>Ebcdic</b> command so it no longer adds null bytes to
    each returned element.</li>
   <li>Allow TclX signal processing to work correctly.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Enhancements:
  <ul>
   <li>Can now specify action(s) to perform when a session has been idle for
    some period of time.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in tcl3270 3.2.19, 1. May 2002</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Corrected the behavior of the <b>Delete</b> command on an unformatted 
    screen.</li>
   <li>Improved the performance of CUT-mode file transfers.</li>
   <li>Corrected the <b>Transfer</b> action.  Numeric arguments always failed,
    and the <b>crlf</b> option was being passed to the host even for binary
    transfers.</li>
   <li>Made the interpretation of model numbers and the 3270 Extendended
    Data Stream consistent with <b>x3270</b>, e.g. <b>-model 3270-2</b> means
    no Extended Data Stream, while <b>-model 3278-2-E</b> causes the Extended
    Data Stream to be enabled.</li>
   <li>Corrected the display of TN3270E mode names in data stream traces.<li>
   <li>Removed use of the <i>memccpy</i>() library function, which is
    apparently broken on some platforms and causes malformed Query Reply
    messages to be generated.</li>
   <li>Fixed an infinite loop in the <b>SysReq</b> action in TN3270E mode.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Enhancements:
  <ul>
   <li>Removed the association between the <b>-E</b> suffix on the model number
    and the <b>-E</b> transmitted with the terminal name on the telnet session.
    A <b>-e</b> will now be silently ignored in the model number value; the
    <b>-E></b> transmitted with the telnet terminal type string (indicating
    support for the 3270 Extended Data Stream) is now controlled by the
    <b>tcl3270.extended</b> resource (which defaults to <b>true</b>), or by the
    presence of an <b>s:</b> prefix on the hostname, which turns off the
    <b>-E</b> when connecting to that host.</li>
   <li>Allow CR/LF translation on binary transfers.</li>
   <li>Allow ASCII files that already contain CR/LF sequences to be transferred
    to the host.</li>
   <li>Added simulation of /dev/fd/ for trace files.</li>
   <li>Updated to autoconf 2.53.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>Toggle</b> action.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in tcl3270 3.2.18, 31. December 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Create directories as needed for <tt>make install</tt>.</li>
   <li>Added better error detection to full-table character set
       definitions.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Enhancements:
  <ul>
   <li>Included the autoconf <tt>configure.in</tt> file, so that users can
    run a newer or customized <i>autoconf</i> on it.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>color8</b> resource.  When set to <b>true</b>, <i>tcl3270</i>
    will only do a Query Reply report on 8 colors.  The default of 16 seems to
    confuse some hosts.</li>
   <li>Added Euro symbol support, using ISO 8859-15 fonts.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>traceFileSize</b> resource and <b>-tracefilesize</b> option
    to limit the size of trace files.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in tcl3270 3.2.17, 25. June 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Installation Changes:
  <ul>
   <li>Moved the feature disable logic (turning off NVT mode, file transfers,
    etc.) to <b>configure --disable</b> options.</li>
   <li>Allowed the location of the configuration directory (where the
    character set files are) to be set with a new resource:
    <tt>tcl3270.confDir</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Verified that tcl3270 builds with all permutations of disabled
    features.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with 3270 Modify Field orders that specify no
    attributes.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with misinterpreting skipped 3270 field attributes.</li>
   <li>Compatibility changes for Cygwin.</li>
   <li>Improved the performance of DFT file transfers.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Character Set Improvements:
  <ul>
   <li>Added support for other 8-bit character sets (Latin-5, etc.).</li>
   <li>Added support for Turkish, ISO Hebrew, Russian, Thai and Brazilian
    character sets.</li>
   <li>Added support for file-based character sets, in the <tt>charset</tt>
    subdirectory of the configuration directory.</li>
   <li>Added support for specifying an entire character set translation table,
    rather than listing the exceptions from ISO 8859-1.</li>
   <li>Added support for file transfer character sets (a definition of how
    the host translates EBCDIC to ASCII for file transfers).</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Other Improvements:
  <ul>
   <li>Added support for <b>BackTab</b> in <b>String</b> actions, via the
    <tt>\T</tt> sequence.</li>
   <li>Allow IPv6-style square-bracket-delimited hostnames, and tightened the
    rules for port numbers.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in tcl3270 3.2.16, 28. February 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Removed the stray reference to x3270if from the Makefile template.</li>
 <li>Changed the configure script to find the BSD versions of the TclX
  library.</li>
 <li>Added a timeout parameter to the <b>Wait</b> command.</li>
 <li>Added an Italian character set.<li>
 <li>Added translations ASCII file transfers, so square brackets, pipe 
   characters and anything from the upper half of the IOS 8859-1 character set
   stand a better chance of coming through correctly.</li> 
 <li>Corrected a subtle problem in TN3270E option negotiation.</li>
 <li>Improved SSCP-LU support.</li>
 <li>Restored the operation of CUT-mode file transfer. (It had been disabled
   early in the 3.2 development cycle.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in tcl3270 3.2.15, 26. December 2000</h2>
<ul>

<li>Corrected the behavior of <b>Ascii</b> and <b>Snap Ascii</b> when four
arguments are supplied.</li>
<li>Changed the default version of the <b>tcl</b> library to 8.3 (8.2 is still
supported with the <tt>configure --with-tcl=8.2</tt> option).</li>
<li>Added support for Extended Tcl (TclX), via the <tt>configure
--with-tclx</tt> option.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with disconnecting from hosts when they send illegal
commands in non-TN3270E mode.</li>
