<h1> ws3270 Build Instructions</h1>
<i>ws3270</i> is built on Windows using the MinGW tools under Cygwin.
For more information about MinGW, visit the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">
MinGW webpage</a>.
For more information about Cygwin, visit the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">
Cygwin webpage</a>.
<p>
The minimum set of Cygwin packages needed to build <i>ws3270</i> are:
 <ul>
     <li>The default set (bash, etc.)</li>
     <li>The <b>make</b> package from the <b>Devel</b> group.</li>
     <li>The <b>gcc-core</b> package from the <b>Devel</b> group.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>[optional]</b> If you want SSL support, you will need to build a MinGW OpenSSL library.
 That requres the following packages:
 <ul>
     <li>The <b>openssl</b> package from the <b>Net</b> group.  Note that you
     want the <i>source</i> for <b>openssl</b>, not just the binaries.</li>
     <li>The <b>perl</b> package from the <b>Interpreters</b> group.</li>
 </ul>
 <b>[optional]</b> To build and install the OpenSSL library, use the following
 Cygwin shell commands:
 <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd /usr/src/openssl-*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Configure --prefix=/usr/local/mingw-openssl mingw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make install</pre>
</p>
<p>
To build <i>ws3270</i> (with or without SSL support), start a Cygwin shell,
<b>cd</b> to the directory where the source code resides, and type:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make</pre>
</p>
  <i>ws3270</i> was developed primarily on 32-bit Windows XP, but should be
  buildable on Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 (though Windows 2000 has
  been known to build defective <i>ws3270</i> DLLs).  It has not been built
  on 64-bit Windows or on Windows Vista.
<p>
  The source tarball also includes an <b>.iss</b> file for use with Inno
  Setup.  This is used to construct the install executable.  See the
  <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup webpage</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
  <i>ws3270</i> can also be built on Linux, using the MinGW cross-compiler.
  (This is how public releases of <i>ws3270</i> are built.)
  The precise method for building a cross-compiler varies with gcc, Binutils
  and MinGW releases, but
  <a href="http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-cross">this link</a> should
  get you started.
