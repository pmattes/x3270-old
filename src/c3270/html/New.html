<h1>New Features in c3270 3.3
<hr width="100%"></h1>
c3270 3.3 is the future development line for c3270. It is functionally equivalent
to c3270 3.2.20, with the addition of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) support and
DBCS (Double Byte Character Set) support for East Asian languages -- Chinese,
Japanese and Korean.
<p>The DBCS work required a significant change in the internal workings of
c3270. For those familiar with the source code, the change was to store EBCDIC
codes internally, and to dispense with the confusing CG-code representation
of the 3270 display. This required changing all of the logic that manipulates
field attributes, as well as the logic that translates the host output, keyboard
input, and X11 display output.</p>
<p>A few eggs were broken in that process:</p>
<ul>
 <li>'Flipped' mode (for right-to-left languages) is disabled.</li>
 <li>pr3287 does not support DBCS.</li>
 <li>File Transfer does not handle DBCS characters properly.</li>
</ul>
And other bugs may yet lurk.
<p>However, once c3270 3.3 is stable enough and the broken features have been
corrected, it will replace c3270 3.2.</p>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.1alpha10, 7. September 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
   <ul>
    <li>Made nondisplay fields invisible to the <b>Ascii()</b> action.</li>
    <li>Corrected start-field values at the beginning of data stream traces
     and in the 3270 Read Buffer response.</li>
    <li>Corrected a tight loop in the macro error cancellation logic.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
   <ul>
    <li>Added a <b>ReadBuffer()</b> action to dump the entire contents of
     the 3270 buffer, including field attributes and extended attributes.</li>
    <li>Added a <b>suppressActions</b> resource, a list of the names of
     actions to disable.  This is primarily for controlled environments where
     the user does not have access to the <b>c3270</b> command line, but can
     edit keymap definitions.</li>
    <li>Added a <b>Setverbose</b> function to <tt>x3270_glue.expect</tt>
     to allow verbosity to be changed on the fly.

   </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.1alpha9, 25. July 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
   <ul>
    <li>Removed the concept of 'per-host' resources.  Use profiles for
     this.</li>
    <li>Fixed idle commands.  They were pretty much hopeless in 3.3.1alpha8
     and 3.2.20.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in processing the Modify Field order, which would cause
     the character set attribute for the field to be accidentally reset to
     the default.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
   <ul>
    <li>The TELNET START-TLS option is now supported.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.1alpha8, 15. April 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:</li>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The EBCDIC <i>notsign</i> '&not;' can now be entered with <tt>Ctrl-A,
^</tt> (it formerly caused an error message).<br>
    </li>
    <li>3270-specific and NVT-mode-specific keymaps (e.g., keymap.base.3270)
are no longer ignored.</li>
    <li>When there is an ambiguous multi-character match in a keymap, the
correct matching keymap entry is now displayed in the keyboard event trace
file.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Builds cleanly on Linux with <tt>-Wall -ansi -pedantic</tt>.</li>
    <li>Builds without OpenSSL libraries being present.</li>
    <li>Correctly records Field Attributes in the initial screen snapshot
in a Data Stream Trace file.</li>
    <li>Auto-Skip fields work properly.</li>
    <li>"Dead" positions in DBCS fields are handled correctly.</li>
    <li>Invalid host DBCS characters are handled better and are displayed
in the Data Stream Trace file.</li>
    <li>The <b>Erase</b> action now works properly with DBCS characters.</li>
    <li>The <b>Visible Control Characters</b> toggle now works properly.</li>
  
  </ul>
  <li>New Features:</li>
  
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Ctrl-A, a</tt> is now mapped onto the <b>Attn</b> action in the
default 3270 keymap.</li>
    <li>Four more Japanese host code pages have been added: 930, 939, 1390
and 1399. This uses new support for combined SBCS/DBCS code pages.</li>
  
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.3.1, 14. February 2003</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:        
    <ul>
   <li>(Same as c3270 3.2.20)</li>
       
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>New Features:        
    <ul>
   <li>DBCS support for Simplfied Chinese and Japanese, including integration
    with XIM.</li>
   <li>Tunneled SSL support added (entire Telnet session inside of an SSL
    tunnel).  Uses the OpenSSL library.  Toggled with an 'l:' (ell) prefix
on     the hostname.</li>
       
    </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
