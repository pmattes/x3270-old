New Features in c3270 3.3
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>
c3270 3.3 is the future development line for c3270.
It is functionally equivalent to c3270 3.2.20, with the addition of SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer) support and DBCS (Double Byte Character Set) support for East
Asian languages -- Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
<p>
The DBCS work required a significant change in the internal workings of
c3270.
For those familiar with the source code, the change was to store EBCDIC codes
internally, and to dispense with the confusing CG-code representation of the
3270 display.
This required changing all of the logic that manipulates field attributes,
as well as the logic that translates the host output, keyboard input, and
X11 display output.
<p>
A few eggs were broken in that process:
<ul>
 <li>'Flipped' mode (for right-to-left languages) is disabled.</li>
 <li>pr3287 does not support DBCS.</li>
 <li>File Transfer does not handle DBCS characters properly.</li>
</ul>
And other bugs may yet lurk.
<p>
However, once c3270 3.3 is stable enough and the broken features have been
corrected, it will replace c3270 3.2.
