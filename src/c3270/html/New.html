<h1>
c3270 Version 3.2 -- New Features and Bug Fixes</h1>
c3270 is a curses-based version of x3270 3.2.
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.2.19, 1. May 2002</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Corrected the behavior of the <b>Delete</b> action on an unformatted 
    screen.</li>
   <li>Improved the performance of CUT-mode file transfers.</li>
   <li>Send script errors back to the script, rather than displaying it on
     c3270's stderr.</li>
   <li>Corrected the parsing of the profile file.  Line continuations were
    being accepted on comment lines, and (illegal) comment lines starting
    with <b>#</b> with continuations caused infinite loops.</li>
   <li>Corrected the <b>Transfer</b> action.  Numeric arguments always failed,
    and the <b>crlf</b> option was being passed to the host even for binary
    transfers.</li>
   <li>Made the interpretation of model numbers and the 3270 Extendended
    Data Stream consistent with <b>x3270</b>, e.g. <b>-model 3270-2</b> means
    no Extended Data Stream, while <b>-model 3278-2-E</b> causes the Extended
    Data Stream to be enabled.</li>
   <li>Corrected the display of TN3270E mode names in data stream traces.<li>
   <li>Removed use of the <i>memccpy</i>() library function, which is
    apparently broken on some platforms and causes malformed Query Reply
    messages to be generated.</li>
   <li>Prevent dropping to the <b>c3270></b> prompt when a socket error is
    encountered, if a hostname is specified on the command line.</li>
   <li>Fixed an infinite loop in the <b>SysReq</b> action in TN3270E mode.</li>
   <li>Corrected the display of extended field attributes (underline, reverse,
    highlight) in 3278 (monochrome) emulation mode.</li>
   <li>Removed the duplicate display of Key events.</li>
   <li>Fixed the symbolic definition of the Delete key.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Enhancements:
  <ul>
   <li>Can now operate with just one extra line for the status line.</liu>
   <li>Removed the association between the <b>-E</b> suffix on the model number
    and the <b>-E</b> transmitted with the terminal name on the telnet session.
    A <b>-e</b> will now be silently ignored in the model number value; the
    <b>-E></b> transmitted with the telnet terminal type string (indicating
    support for the 3270 Extended Data Stream) is now controlled by the
    <b>c3270.extended</b> resource (which defaults to <b>true</b>), or by the
    presence of an <b>s:</b> prefix on the hostname, which turns off the
    <b>-E</b> when connecting to that host.</li>
   <li>Allow CR/LF translation on binary transfers.</li>
   <li>Allow ASCII files that already contain CR/LF sequences to be transferred
    to the host.</li>
   <li>Implemented the <b>secure</b> option (<tt>-xrm 'c3270.secure: true'</tt>)
    to disable the <b>c3270></b> prompt.</li>
   <li>Added the LU name to the status line.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>cursesKeypad</b> resource to control whether curses runs in
    keypad mode (and returns symbolic names like <b>UP</b> and <b>F1</b>).
    The default value is <b>true</b>.  (Courtesy of Brandon Hill.)</li>
   <li>Added simulation of /dev/fd/ for trace files.</li>
   <li>Updated to autoconf 2.53.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>Toggle</b> action.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>-printerlu</b> option and <b>printerLu</b> resource to
    automatically start a <b>pr3287</b> printer session.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.2.18, 31. December 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Install the ibm_hosts man page in section 5, not 1.</li>
   <li>Create directories as needed in <tt>make install</tt>.</li>
   <li>Added better error detection to full-table character set
    definitions.</li>
   <li>Fixed a scripting problem with percent "%" characters on the screen.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Enhancements:
  <ul>
   <li>Included the autoconf <tt>configure.in</tt> file, so that users can
    run a newer or customized <i>autoconf</i> on it.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>color8</b> resource.  When set to <b>true</b>, <i>c3270</i>
    will only do a Query Reply report on 8 colors.  The default of 16 seems to
    confuse some hosts.</li>
   <li>Made <b>-allbold</b> the default for color terminals.  To disable this,
    set the resource <b>c3270.allBold</b> to <b>false</b>.</li>
   <li>Added Euro symbol support, using ISO 8859-15 fonts.</li>
   <li>Added support for terminals which generate ESC for the Alt key, such as
    Linux and Cygwin consoles.  On such terminals, ESC followed (quickly) by
    another key is interpreted as pressing Meta with that key.  It is usually
    controlled by the termcap <b>km</b> attribute: if <b>km</b> is set, the
    keyboard has a proper Meta key and the feature is disabled; otherwise it is
    enabled. To force this feature on or off, set the resource
    <b>c3270.metaEscape</b> to <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, respectively.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>Ctrl-A e</b> as an alternate escape seqence.</li>
   <li>Added a default mapping of <b>Ctrl-A i</b> for <b>Insert()</b>.</li>
   <li>Added a <b>traceFileSize</b> resource and <b>-tracefilesize</b> option
    to limit the size of trace files.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.2.17, 25. June 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Installation Changes:
  <ul>
   <li>Moved the feature disable logic (turning off NVT mode, file transfers,
    etc.) to <b>configure --disable</b> options.</li>
   <li>Moved the ibm_hosts file to /usr/local/etc/x3270 by default.  This can be
    changed with <tt>configure --sysconfdir=</tt>.</li>
   <li>Allowed the location of the configuration directory (where the
    <tt>ibm_hosts</tt> and character set files are) to be set with a new
     resource: <tt>c3270.confDir</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Verified that c3270 builds with all permutations of disabled
    features.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with 3270 Modify Field orders that specify no
    attributes.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with misinterpreting skipped 3270 field attributes.</li>
   <li>Removed the redundant <i>localhost</i> entry from the default
    <tt>ibm_hosts</tt> file.
    Changed the rules for accessing <tt>ibm_hosts</tt> -- now it is accessed
    only when the supplied hostname has no qualifiers.</li>
   <li>Compatibility changes for Cygwin.</li>
   <li>Improved the performance of DFT file transfers.</li>
   <li>Removed default keymap definitions which use the Meta key, which
    interferes with the entry of many characters.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Character Set Improvements:
  <ul>
   <li>Added support for other 8-bit character sets (Latin-5, etc.).</li>
   <li>Added support for Turkish, ISO Hebrew, Russian, Thai and Brazilian
    character sets.</li>
   <li>Added support for file-based character sets, in the <tt>charset</tt>
    subdirectory of the configuration directory.</li>
   <li>Added support for specifying an entire character set translation table,
    rather than listing the exceptions from ISO 8859-1.</li>
   <li>Added support for file transfer character sets (a definition of how
    the host translates EBCDIC to ASCII for file transfers).</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Other Improvements:
  <ul>
   <li>Added an -allbold option and allBold resource to force all characters to
    be displayed in bold.  This helps with PC consoles which display non-bold
    characters in unreadably dim colors.</li>
   <li>Added the PrintText action from x3270, to send a screen snapshot to the
    printer.</li>
   <li>Added support for <b>BackTab</b> in <b>String</b> actions, via the
    <tt>\T</tt> sequence.</li>
   <li>Added support for 3270-mode keymaps (like NVT-mode keymaps).  Changed
     the <b>base</b> and <b>nometa</b> keymaps to have default and 3270-only
     components.  Changed the definition of NVT-mode keymaps so they augment the
     default, rather than replacing it. <b>[Incompatible change]</b></li>
   <li>Allow IPv6-style square-bracket-delimited hostnames, and tightened the
    rules for port numbers.</li>
   <li>Nearly all error messages and output from scripts is now captured
    without corrupting the display.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.2.16, 28. February 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Added a <tt>--without-pr3287</tt> option to the configure script, to
  skip building pr3287.
 <li>Added a timeout parameter to the scripting <b>Wait</b> action.</li>
 <li>Added <b>Snap(Wait Output)</b>.</li>
 <li>Added an Italian character set.<li>
 <li>Mapped the "<b>&not;</b>" symbol to the Meta-<b>^</b>. key</li>
 <li>Added translations ASCII file transfers, so square brackets, pipe 
   characters and anything from the upper half of the IOS 8859-1 character set
   stand a better chance of coming through correctly.</li>
 <li>Corrected a subtle problem in TN3270E option negotiation.</li>
 <li>Fixed curses/readline initialization problems.</li>
 <li>Improved SSCP-LU support.</li>
 <li>Restored the operation of CUT-mode file transfer. (It had been disabled
   early in the 3.2 development cycle.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in c3270 3.2.15, 26. December 2000</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed the keymap logic to stop re-reading keymap files each time the
mode switches.</li>
<li>Set the terminal type correctly on non-color displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with disconnecting from hosts when they send illegal
commands in non-TN3270E mode.</li>
<li>Allow, but ignore, Create Partition structured fields.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Changes in c3270 3.2.14, 15. November 2000</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Use GNU autoconf to generate the Makefile and set up configuration options.</li>

<li>
Allow multiple-character sequences in keymaps.</li>

<li>
Removed Control-key definitions from the base keymap.</li>

<li>
Added various <tt>Ctrl&lt;Key>A</tt> combinations to the base keymap:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>Ctrl&lt;Key>A &lt;Key>Tab </tt>is BackTab</li>

<li>
<tt>Ctrl&lt;Key>A &lt;Key>F1 </tt>is PF(13), etc.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<tt>Ctrl&lt;Key>A </tt>combinations are also defined for all Meta combinations,
e.g.:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>Ctrl&lt;Key>A &lt;Key>c </tt>is Clear</li>

<li>
<tt>Ctrl&lt;Key>A &lt;Key>1 </tt>is PA(1), etc.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Added a new <b>nometa</b> keymap, substituting the <b>Escape</b> key for
the <b>Meta</b> key.</li>

<li>
Allow <b>Escape</b>, <b>Tab</b>, <b>Return</b>, <b>BackSpace</b>, and <b>Linefeed</b>
to be used as symbolic key names in keymaps, instead of having to figure
out arcane Control-key combinations.</li>

<li>
Exposed the default mappings in a new <b>base</b> keymap, so that <tt>show
keymap</tt> shows all of the mappings.</li>

<li>
Improved the behavior of the interactive pager.</li>

<li>
Fixed a couple of endcases around curses initialization and failure conditions.</li>
<li>
Added support for NVT-mode keymaps, via the <b>c3270.keymap.</b><i>name</i><b>.nvt</b> resource</li>
<li>
Added pr3287 printer session support.</li>
</ul>
