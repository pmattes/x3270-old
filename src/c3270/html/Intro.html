c3270 is a curses-based IBM 3270 terminal emulator.  It can be used to
communicate with any IBM host that supports 3270-style connections over TELNET.
It can also communicate with hosts that use line-by-line ASCII mode to do
initial login negotiation before switching to full-screen 3270 mode.
<P>
c3270 emulates one of four models of an IBM 3278 or 3279 terminal.  The
difference between the various models is the screen size.  The emulation is
not quite complete; c3270 understands extended field orders but does not
implement some of the extended attributes (outlining, extended validation,
etc.).
