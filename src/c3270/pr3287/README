pr3287 is an IBM 3287 printer emulator.  It connects to an IBM host via TELNET,
using TN3270 or TN3270E.  It supports SCS (SNA Character Stream).

To build pr3287, type:

    ./configure
    make

To install pr3287 in /usr/local/bin, type (as root):

    make install

If you are running Sun Solaris and have Sun's unbundled C compiler installed,
_do_not_ use it to build pr3287.  Instead, type:

    make CC=/usr/ccs/bin/cc
