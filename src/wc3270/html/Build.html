<h1> wc3270 Build Instructions</h1>
<h2>Building wc3270.exe</h2>
<i>wc3270</i> is built on Windows using the MinGW tools under Cygwin.
For more information about MinGW, visit the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">
MinGW webpage</a>.
For more information about Cygwin, visit the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">
Cygwin webpage</a>.
<p>
  To build <i>wc3270</i>, start a Cygwin shell, <b>cd</b> to the directory where
  the source code resides, and type:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make</pre>
</p>
<p>
  This process will probably fail (sorry) because the Makefile assumes that you
  have installed a MinGW-compatible version of the OpenSSL library.  This is
  not a commonly-available package but can be easily built from source.
  Visit the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL webpage</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
  To build without SSL support, there are three lines to comment out in the
  <b>Makefile</b> before running <b>make</b>.
</p>
  <i>wc3270</i> was developed primarily on 32-bit Windows XP, but should be
  buildable on Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000.  It has not been built
  or tested on 64-bit Windows or on Windows Vista.
<p>
  The source tarball also includes an <b>.iss</b> file for use with Inno
  Setup.  This is used to construct the install executable.  See the
  <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup webpage</a> for details.
</p>
<h2>Building wc3270wiz.exe</h2>
<i>wc3270wiz</i>, the New Session Wizard, is a Windows GUI application.
It is built with Microsoft Visual C++.
The Express Edition of Visual C++ 2005 is available free from Microsoft
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/">here</a>.
<p>
To build <i>wc3270wiz</i>, unpack the <b>wc3270wiz.tgz</b> tarball into a
directory on your machine, then use the Visual C++ <b>File -&gt; Open -&gt;
Project/Solution</b> menu option to open the <b>wc3270wiz.wcproj</b> file.
You can then use Visual C++ to inspect, modify and build the code.
