<h1>New Features in s3270 3.3
<hr width="100%"></h1>
s3270 3.3 is the future development line for s3270. It is functionally equivalent
to s3270 3.2.20, with the addition of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) support
and DBCS (Double Byte Character Set) support for East Asian languages --
Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
<p>The DBCS work required a significant change in the internal workings of
s3270. For those familiar with the source code, the change was to store EBCDIC
codes internally, and to dispense with the confusing CG-code representation
of the 3270 display. This required changing all of the logic that manipulates
field attributes, as well as the logic that translates the host output, keyboard
input, and X11 display output.</p>
<p>A few eggs were broken in that process:</p>
<ul>
 <li>pr3287 does not support DBCS.</li>
 <li>File Transfer does not handle DBCS characters properly.</li>
</ul>
And other bugs may yet lurk.
<p>However, once s3270 3.3 is stable enough and the broken features have
been corrected, it will replace s3270 3.2.</p>
<h2>Changes in s3270 3.3.1alpha10, 6. September 2003</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Made nondisplay fields invisible to the <b>Ascii()</b> action.</li>
      <li>Corrected start-field values at the beginning of data stream traces
       and in the 3270 Read Buffer response.</li>
      <li>Corrected a tight loop in the macro error cancellation logic.</li>
      <li>Fixed idle commands.  They were pretty much hopeless in 3.2.20.</li>
      <li>Fixed a Unicode conversion crash.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in processing the Modify Field order, which would cause
       the character set attribute for the field to be accidentally reset to
       the default.</li>
      <li>Builds cleanly on Linux with <tt>-Wall -ansi -pedantic</tt>.</li>
      <li>Builds without OpenSSL libraries being present.</li>
      <li>Correctly records Field Attributes in the initial screen snapshot
in a Data Stream Trace file.</li>
      <li>Auto-Skip fields work properly.</li>
      <li>"Dead" positions in DBCS fields are handled correctly.</li>
      <li>Invalid host DBCS characters are handled better and are displayed
in the Data Stream Trace file.</li>
      <li>The <b>Erase</b> action now works properly with DBCS characters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added a <b>ReadBuffer()</b> action to dump the entire contents of
      the 3270 buffer, including field attributes and extended attributes.</li>
     <li>Added support for <b>suppress</b> resources for each menu item.
      If set to <b>True</b>, that menu item will not appear.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>suppressActions</b> resource, a list of the names of
      actions to disable.  This is primarily for controlled environments where
      the user does not have access to the <b>s3270</b> command line, but can
      edit keymap definitions.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>Setverbose</b> function to <tt>x3270_glue.expect</tt>
       to allow verbosity to be changed on the fly.

      <li>The TELNET START-TLS option is now supported.</li>
      <li>Four more Japanese host code pages have been added: 930, 939, 1390
       and 1399. This uses new support for combined SBCS/DBCS code pages.</li>
      <li>DBCS support for Simplfied Chinese and Japanese, including integration
       with XIM.</li>
      <li>Tunneled SSL support added (entire Telnet session inside of an SSL
       tunnel).  Uses the OpenSSL library.  Toggled with an 'L:' prefix
        on the hostname.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
