<h1>
s3270 Version 3.2 -- New Features and Bug Fixes</h1>
s3270 is all-new code, based on the scripting functions of x3270 3.2.
<h2>Changes in s3270 3.2.17, 15. June 2001</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Installation Changes:
  <ul>
   <li>Moved the feature disable logic (turning off NVT mode, file transfers,
    etc.) to <b>configure --disable</b> options.</li>
   <li>Allowed the location of the configuration directory (where the
    character set files are) to be set with a new resource:
    <tt>s3270.confDir</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Bug Fixes:
  <ul>
   <li>Verified that s3270 builds with all permutations of disabled
    features.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with 3270 Modify Field orders that specify no
    attributes.</li>
   <li>Fixed a problem with misinterpreting skipped 3270 field attributes.</li>
   <li>Compatibility changes for Cygwin.</li>
   <li>Improved the performance of DFT file transfers.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Character Set Improvements:
  <ul>
   <li>Added support for other 8-bit character sets (Latin-5, etc.).</li>
   <li>Added support for Turkish, ISO Hebrew, Russian, Thai and Brazilian
    character sets.</li>
   <li>Added support for file-based character sets, in the <tt>charset</tt>
    subdirectory of the configuration directory.</li>
   <li>Added support for specifying an entire character set translation table,
    rather than listing the exceptions from ISO 8859-1.</li>
   <li>Added support for file transfer character sets (a definition of how
    the host translates EBCDIC to ASCII for file transfers).</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Other Improvements:
  <ul>
   <li>Added support for <b>BackTab</b> in <b>String</b> actions, via the
    <tt>\T</tt> sequence.</li>

 </li>

 <li>Corrected a subtle problem in TN3270E option negotiation.</li>
 <li>Improved SSCP-LU support.</li>
 <li>Restored the operation of CUT-mode file transfer. (It had been disabled
