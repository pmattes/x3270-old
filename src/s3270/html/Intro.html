s3270 is a scripted IBM 3270 terminal emulator.  It can be used to
communicate with any IBM host that supports 3270-style connections over TELNET.
It can also communicate with hosts that use line-by-line ASCII mode to do
initial login negotiation before switching to full-screen 3270 mode.
<P>
s3270 emulates one of four models of an IBM 3278 or 3279 terminal.  The
difference between the various models is the screen size.  The emulation is
not quite complete; s3270 understands extended field orders but does not
implement some of the extended attributes (outlining, extended validation,
etc.).  It does not support 3179G bit-mapped graphics (GDDM).
<P>
s3270 supports the APL character set and several international character sets.
Many APL and international symbols may be entered by their X11 symbol names.
