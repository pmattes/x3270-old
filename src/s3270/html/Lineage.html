The original work was 3270tool, a 3270 emulator for Suntools (Sun's original
proprietary windowing environment).  This was developed by Robert Viduya at
Georgia Tech, and is why GTRC's copyright notice is first.
<P>
3270tool was then ported to X11R4 by Jeff Sparkes, and given the name "x3270."
This is why his name is second.
<P>
x3270 3.1 started with Jeff's x3270 version 1.2, and was made very much bigger
by Paul Mattes, with contributions and suggestions by a number of users from
the net.
<P>
x3270 then evolved into version 3.2, which is built much more modularly; a
subset of that version is this code, s3270.
